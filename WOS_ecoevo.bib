Abstract = {A proposal for text mining as a support for knowledge discovery on
   biological descriptions is introduced. Our aim is both to sustain the
   curation of databases and to offer an alternative representation frame
   for accessing information in the biodiversity domain. We work on raw
   texts with minimum human intervention, applying natural language
   processing to integrate linguistic and domain knowledge in a
   mathematical model that makes it possible to capture concepts and
   relationships between them in a computable form, using conceptual
   graphs. This provides a reasoning basis for determining semantic
   disjointedness or subsumption, as well as sub and super-concept
   relationships. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Information on food microbial diversity is scattered across millions of
   scientific papers. Researchers need tools to assist their bibliographic
   search in such large collections. Text mining and knowledge engineering
   methods are useful to automatically and efficiently find relevant
   information in Life Science. This work describes how the Alvis text
   mining platform has been applied to a large collection of PubMed
   abstracts of scientific papers in the food microbiology domain. The
   information targeted by our work is microorganisms, their habitats and
   phenotypes. Two knowledge resources, the NCBI taxonomy and the
   OntoBiotope ontology were used to detect this information in texts. The
   result of the text mining process was indexed and is presented through
   the AlvisIR Food on-line semantic search engine. In this paper, we also
   show through two illustrative examples the great potential of this new
   tool to assist in studies on ecological diversity and the origin of
   microbial presence in food. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   of selected journals},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {162},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {In this study, network and main path analyses were conducted on 1856
   studies related to text mining, by extracting keywords and citation
   information from the text of each paper. Our findings indicate that
   research papers on text mining have been published in 45 academic
   disciplines in the 1980s and 1990s, 105 disciplines in the 2000s, and
   171 disciplines in the 2010s. The results show that using text mining as
   a research topic and method has rapidly increased. We also demonstrate
   that the main theme of text mining research is discourse and content
   analysis in the 1980s and 1990s, biology and data mining in the 2000s,
   and medicine and advanced text mining in the 2010s. Moreover, we
   examined the main citation path for text mining studies and suggest that
   the main focus of text mining studies has evolved from information
   science to information systems and technology management. Additionally,
   influential papers have been recently published in fields such as
   architecture and social ecology revealing the wide scope of text mining.
   This article presents an understanding of previously unexplored research
   trends in text mining and how these trends shed light on the most
   influential academic papers in the field.},

Abstract = {The literature on climate change research has evolved tremendously since
   the 1990s. The goal of this study is to use text mining to review the
   climate change literature and study the evolution of the main trends
   over time. Specific keywords from articles published in the special
   issue `` Industrial Ecology for Climate Change Adaptation and
   Resilience{''} in the Journal of Industrial Ecology are first selected.
   Details of over 35,000 publications containing these keywords are
   downloaded from the Web of Science from 1990 to 2018. The number of
   publications and co-occurrence of keywords are analyzed. Moreover,
   latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-a probabilistic approach that can
   retrieve topics from large and unstructured text documents-is applied on
   the abstracts to uncover the main topics (consisting of new terms) that
   naturally emerge from them. The evolution in time of the importance of
   some emerging topics is then analyzed on the basis of their relative
   frequency. Overall, a rapid growth in climate change publications is
   observed. Terms such as ``climate change adaptation{''} appear on the
   rise, whereas other terms are declining such as ``pollution.{''}
   Moreover, several terms tend to co-occur frequently, such as ``climate
   change adaptation{''} and ``resilience.{''} The database collected and
   the LiTCoF (Literature Topic Co-occurrence and Frequency) Python-based
   tool developed for this study are also made openly accessible. This
   article met the requirements for a gold - gold JIE data openness badge

   mining approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {537-554},
Abstract = {Although it is obvious that research regarding Sustainable Forest
   Management (SFM) is context specific and developed over time, not many
   research papers yet intended to investigate these changes. As a matter
   of fact, the number of scientific publications addressing SFM is
   relatively high. Hence, such a wide field cannot be sufficiently covered
   by traditional literature review approaches. With this paper, we aim at
   identifying the most convergent narratives within the SFM-research
   landscape by applying a text mining methodology to recent scientific
   literature. By doing so, we generated results that indicate that there
   may have been three phases in the evolution of SFM-research: the early
   phase covers in particular issues regarding land use in tropical and
   developing countries. Furthermore, papers in this phase tend to focus on
   general concepts or policy issues. In contrast, the second phase is
   characterized by a larger share of publications in forestry focused
   journals. This process is seemingly connected with issues like forest
   management, certification, forest stand management and the development
   of sustainability indicators. A third phase can be observed by the
   relative downturn of publications in forest-focused journals between
   2005 and 2010. A new focus in this period is climate change.},

   Case Study in South Korea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {102},
Pages = {47-53},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Land development activities performed in coastal areas are accompanied
   by environmental impacts, and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is
   used to mitigate such impacts. The characteristics of coastal
   environmental policy can be determined based on the content of EIA
   reports for development projects However, owing to the vast amounts of
   information regarding various environmental factors, including air,
   water, and soil, contained in such reports, their potential for analysis
   is limited. This study analyzed the terms of agreement for development
   projects-theresult of EIA of coastal areas-using bibliometrics, a method
   that is widely used to analyze trends in academic research. Data on the
   EIA of coastal development projects conducted in South Korea over the
   past 25 years were collected, and the surveyed period was sub-divided
   into five-year periods to build datasets through text mining.
   Subsequently, trends in coastal environmental policy were analyzed over
   an extended period. The results of the analysis indicated that keywords
   related to the water environment showed the highest appearance frequency
   for the entire period due to the characteristics of coastal development
   projects. Keywords related to the natural ecological environment
   continued to show an increasing trend, while those related to the land
   environment showed a continuously decreasing trend. Based on
   correspondence analysis, the five sub-divided periods were broadly
   classified into three groups, and the principal inertia of the analysis
   was found to be approximately 89.6 \%. The characteristics of the
   coastal environmental policy that were emphasized for each period were
   determined; land and life environments were found to be emphasized for
   the period between 1994 and 1999; water environments were emphasized
   between 2000 and 2009; and natural ecology environments were emphasized
   between 2010 and 2019. By contrast, atmospheric and socio-economic
   environments did not show a significant correlation. This study proposes
   methods of utilizing information provided by EIA reports to analyze
   environmental policy and offers new insights specifically applicable to
   coastal environmental policy.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Capturing countries' commitments for measuring and monitoring progress
   towards certain goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs), remains underexplored. The Agrobiodiversity Index bridges this
   gap by using text mining techniques to quantify countries' commitments
   towards safeguarding and using agrobiodiversity for healthy diets,
   sustainable agriculture, and effective genetic resource management. The
   Index extracts potentially relevant sections of official documents,
   followed by manual sifting and scoring to identify
   agrobiodiversity-related commitments and assign scores. Our aim is to
   present the text mining methodology used in the Agrobiodiversity Index
   and the calculated commitments scores for nine countries while
   identifying methodological improvements to strengthen it. Our results
   reveal that levels of commitment towards using and protecting
   agrobiodiversity vary between countries, with most showing the strongest
   commitments to enhancing agrobiodiversity for genetic resource
   management followed by healthy diets. No commitments were found in any
   country related to some specific themes including varietal diversity,
   seed diversity, and functional diversity. The revised text mining
   methodology can be used for benchmarking, learning, and improving
   policies to enable conservation and sustainable use of agrobiodiversity.
   This low-cost, rapid, remotely applicable approach to capture and
   analyse policy commitments can be readily applied for tracking progress
   towards meeting other sustainability objectives.},

Abstract = {In our aim to make the information encapsulated by biodiversity
   literature more accessible and searchable, we have developed a text
   mining-based framework for automatically transforming text into a
   structured knowledge repository. A text mining workflow employing
   information extraction techniques, i.e., named entity recognition and
   relation extraction, was implemented in the Argo platform and was
   subsequently applied on biodiversity literature to extract structured
   information. The resulting annotations were stored in a repository
   following the emerging Open Annotation standard, thus promoting
   interoperability with external applications. Accessible as a SPARQL
   endpoint, the repository facilitates knowledge discovery over a huge
   amount of biodiversity literature by retrieving annotations matching
   user-specified queries. We present some use cases to illustrate the
   types of queries that the knowledge repository currently accommodates.},

Abstract = {Chart type classification through caption analysis is a new area of
   study. Distinct keywords in the captions that relate to the
   visualization vocabulary (e.g., for scatterplot: dot, y-axis, x-axis,
   bubble) and keywords from the specific domain (e.g., species richness,
   species abundance, phylogenetic associations in the case of biodiversity
   research), serve as parameters to train a text classifier. For better
   chart comprehensibility, along with the visual characteristics of the
   chart, a classifier should also understand these parameters well. Such
   conceptual/semantic chart classifiers then will not only be useful for
   chart classification purposes but also for other visualization studies.
   One of the applications of such a classifier is in the creation of the
   domain knowledge-assisted visualization recommendation system, where
   these text classifiers can provide the recommendation of visualization
   types based on the classification of the text provided along with the
   dataset. Motivated by this use case, in this paper, we have explored our
   idea of semantic chart classifiers. We have taken the assistance of
   state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision
   algorithms to create a biodiversity domain-based visualization
   classifier. With an average test accuracy (F1-score) of 92.2\% over all
   15 classes, we can prove that our classifiers can differentiate between
   different chart types conceptually and visually.},

Abstract = {The Biodiversity Heritage Library is the world's largest digital library
   of biodiversity literature. Currently containing almost 40 million
   pages, the library can be explored with a search interface employing
   keyword-matching, which unfortunately fails to address issues brought
   about by ambiguity. Helping alleviate these issues are tools that
   automatically attach semantic metadata to documents, e.g., biodiversity
   concept recognisers. However, gold standard, semantically annotated
   textual corpora are critical for the development of these advanced
   tools. In the biodiversity domain, such corpora are almost non-existent
   especially since the construction of semantically annotated resources is
   typically a time-consuming and laborious process. Aiming to accelerate
   the development of a corpus of biodiversity documents, we propose a text
   mining framework that hastens curation through an iterative
   feedback-loop process of (1) manual annotation, and (2) training and
   application of statistical concept recognition models. Even after only a
   few iterations, our curators were observed to have spent less time and
   effort on annotation.},

Abstract = {Understanding the distribution of taxa and associated traits across
   different environments is one of the central questions in microbial
   ecology. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies are presently
   generating huge volumes of data to address this biogeographical topic.
   However, these studies are often focused on specific environment types
   or processes leading to the production of individual, unconnected
   datasets. The large amounts of legacy sequence data with associated
   metadata that exist can be harnessed to better place the genetic
   information found in these surveys into a wider environmental context.
   Here we introduce a software program, seqenv, to carry out precisely
   such a task. It automatically performs similarity searches of short
   sequences against the ``nt{''} nucleotide database provided by NCBI and,
   out of every hit, extracts if it is available the textual metadata
   field. After collecting all the isolation sources from all the search
   results, we run a text mining algorithm to identify and parse words that
   are associated with the Environmental Ontology (EnvO) controlled
   vocabulary. This, n turn, enables us to determine both in which
   environments individual sequences or taxa have previously been observed
   and, by weighted summation of those results, to summarize complete
   samples. We present two demonstrative applications of seqenv to a survey
   of ammonia oxidizing archaea as well as to a plankton paleome dataset
   from the Black Sea. These demonstrate the ability of the tool to reveal
   novel patterns in HTS and its utility in the fields of environmental
   source tracking, paleontology, and s of microbial biogeography.},

Abstract = {Natural language processing and text mining applications have gained a
   growing attention and diffusion in the computer science and machine
   learning communities. In this work, a new embedding scheme is proposed
   for solving text classification problems. The embedding scheme relies on
   a statistical assessment of relevant words within a corpus using a
   compound index originally proposed in ecology: this allows to spot
   relevant parts of the overall text (e.g., words) on the top of which the
   embedding is performed following a Granular Computing approach. The
   employment of statistically meaningful words not only eases the
   computational burden and the embedding space dimensionality, but also
   returns a more interpretable model. Our approach is tested on both
   synthetic datasets and benchmark datasets against well-known embedding
   techniques, with remarkable results both in terms of performances and
   computational complexity.},

   appeared the most regardless of weighting factors. It was found that
   words associated with plant identification, habitat area, and
   environmental characteristics, those affecting the survival of species
   and those related to conservation policies formed a network
   relationship. The results of this study showed that researchers used
   positive words more than negative words from the 1990s to the 2010s, but
   the use of positive words decreased over time. The results implied that
   the restoration of endangered species was hard socially and
   scientifically. Understanding the research trend on endangered species
   in South Korea will be helpful in developing and proposing important
   directions for endangered species restoration research planned at the
   national level. We hope that various efforts are given to improve
   endangered species restoration research techniques and raise social
   awareness for producing practical achievements. (C) 2020 National

Abstract = {Regional collaboration has become a popular means to manage shared
   resources and address cross-jurisdictional boundary issues. The question
   of who participates in the process, who directly affects decisions, and
   who benefits from those decisions is critical for understanding the
   broader value created by regional collaborations. We apply a variety of
   text mining techniques to meeting minutes to measure how stakeholder
   participation evolved over nine years of an Integrated Regional Water
   Management collaboration. We observe that a diverse set of organizations
   representing differing interests participated to some extent in the
   process. However, a minority of organizations attended regularly, while
   most attended sporadically and/or only attended outreach events. Verbs
   used to describe interaction varied across meeting types, displaying
   egalitarian patterns of interaction among participants in core
   leadership meetings and more one-way interaction among attendees of
   outreach meetings. We then estimate whether participation affects the
   likelihood of receiving funding through the IRWM program. Participants
   who attended the core group meetings most regularly were most likely to
   receive funding for their projects, suggesting that uneven patterns of
   participation matter for the substantive value created by the
   collaboration.},

   and natural language processing methods},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Scholarly publications of biodiversity literature contain a vast amount
   of information in human readable format. The detailed morphological
   descriptions in these publications contain rich information that can be
   extracted to facilitate analysis and computational biology research.
   However, the idiosyncrasies of morphological descriptions still pose a
   number of challenges to machines. In this work, we demonstrate the use
   of two different approaches to resolve meronym (i.e. part-of) relations
   between anatomical parts and their anchor organs, including a syntactic
   rule-based approach and a SVM-based (support vector machine) method.
   Both methods made use of domain ontologies. We compared the two
   approaches with two other baseline methods and the evaluation results
   show the syntactic methods (92.1\% F1 score) outperformed the SVM
   methods (80.7\% F1 score) and the part-of ontologies were valuable
   knowledge sources for the task. It is notable that the mistakes made by
   the two approaches rarely overlapped. Additional tests will be conducted
   on the development version of the Explorer of Taxon Concepts toolkit
   before we make the functionality publicly available. Meanwhile, we will
   further investigate and leverage the complementary nature of the two
   approaches to further drive down the error rate, as in practical
   application, even a 1\% error rate could lead to hundreds of errors.},

Title = {Biodiversity Observations Miner: A web application to unlock primary
   biodiversity data from published literature},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Background
   A considerable portion of primary biodiversity data is digitally locked
   inside published literature which is often stored as pdf files.
   Large-scale approaches to biodiversity science could benefit from
   retrieving this information and making it digitally accessible and
   machine-readable. Nonetheless, the amount and diversity of digitally
   published literature pose many challenges for knowledge discovery and
   retrieval. Text mining has been extensively used for data discovery
   tasks in large quantities of documents. However, text mining approaches
   for knowledge discovery and retrieval have been limited in biodiversity
   science compared to other disciplines.
   New information
   Here, we present a novel, open source text mining tool, the Biodiversity
   Observations Miner (BOM). This web application, written in R, allows the
   semi-automated discovery of punctual biodiversity observations (e.g.
   biotic interactions, functional or behavioural traits and natural
   history descriptions) associated with the scientific names present
   inside a corpus of scientific literature. Furthermore, BOM enable users
   the rapid screening of large quantities of literature based on word
   co-occurrences that match custom biodiversity dictionaries. This tool
   aims to increase the digital mobilisation of primary biodiversity data
   and is freely accessible via GitHub or through a web server.},

Abstract = {Ecological networks are powerful tools for visualizing biodiversity data
   and assessing ecosystem health and function. Constructing these networks
   requires considerable empirical efforts, and this remains highly
   challenging due to sampling limitations and the laborious and
   notoriously limited, error-prone process of traditional taxonomic
   identification. Recent advancements in high-throughput gene sequencing
   and high-performance computing provide new ways to address these
   challenges. DNA metabarcoding, a method of bulk taxonomic identification
   from DNA extracted from environmental samples, can generate detailed
   biodiversity information through a standardizable analytical pipeline
   for species detection. When this biodiversity information is annotated
   with prior knowledge on taxon interactions, body size, and trophic
   position, it is possible to generate trait-based networks, which we call
   ``heuristic food webs{''}. Although curating trait matrices for
   constructing heuristic food webs is a laborious, often intractable
   process using manual literature surveys, it can be greatly accelerated
   via text mining, allowing knowledge of relevant traits to be gathered
   across large databases. To explore this possibility, we employed a
   General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) system to create a
   hybrid text-mining pipeline combining rule-based and machine-learning
   modules. This pipeline was then used to query online repositories of
   published papers for missing data on a key trait, body size, that could
   not be gathered from existing trophic link libraries of freshwater
   benthic macroinvertebrates. Combining text-mined body size information
   with feeding information from existing sources allowed us to generate a
   database of over 20,000 pairwise trophic interactions. Next, we
   developed a pipeline that uses taxa lists generated from DNA
   metabarcoding and annotates this matrix with trophic information from
   existing databases and text-mined body size data. In this way, we
   generated heuristic food webs for wetland sites within a large delta
   complex formed by the confluence of the Peace and Athabasca rivers in
   northern Alberta: the Peace Athabasca delta. Finally, we used these
   putative food webs and their network properties to resolve spatial and
   temporal differences between the benthic subwebs of wetlands in the
   Peace and Athabasca sectors of the delta complex. Specifically, we asked
   two questions. (1) How do food web properties (e.g. number of links,
   linkage density, trophic height) differ between the wetlands of the
   Peace and Athabasca deltas? (2) How do food web properties change
   temporally in wetlands of the two deltas? We discuss using
   DNA-generated, trait-based food webs as a powerful tool for rapid
   bioassessment, assess the limitations of our current approach, and
   outline a path forward to make this powerful tool more widely available
   for land managers and conservation biologists.},

   and relate not only data but also scientific notions, even if the
   information available to start the process is not complete. The use of
   conceptual graphs as a basis for interpretation makes it possible to
   avoid the use of classic ontologies, whose start-up requires costly
   generation and maintenance protocols and also unnecessarily overload the
   accessing task for inexpert users. We exploit the automatic generation
   of these structures from raw texts through graphical and natural

Abstract = {We analyzed the discussions of Japanese municipalities in their process

   Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Man and
   the Biosphere Programme (MAB) by the UNESCO, and the Globally Important
   Agricultural Heritage systems (GIAHS) by the Food and Agriculture
   Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The official records at the
   municipality diet were analyzed in a quantitative manner from 2011 to
   2013. As the first step, we analyzed the eight municipalities of Noto
   and Sado for the GIAHS, the cities Itoigawa and Hakusan for the Geopark,
   and Katsuyama Yamanouchi village from Nagano for the MAB. As individual
   examples, we analyzed City of Suzu with GIAHS, Itoigawa (Geopark), and
   Yamanouchi town (MAB) with the text-mining approach. For the GIAHS, it
   was clear that the larger municipalities with city status tended to
   discuss certification issues more frequently than the smaller towns and
   villages. Terms such as conservation and certification tended to be used
   with GIAHS at the Suzu City. The term brand was used with GIAHS and MAB
   but not for the Geopark. The findings using quantitative methods are at
   initial stage for analysis of municipality strategies and require

Abstract = {The acknowledgments in scientific publications are an important feature
   in the scholarly communication process. This research analyzes funding
   acknowledgment presence in scientific publications and introduces a
   novel approach for discovering text patterns by discipline in the
   acknowledgment section of papers. First, the presence of acknowledgments
   in 38,257 English-language papers published by Spanish researchers in
   2010 is studied by subject area on the basis of the funding
   acknowledgment information available in the Web of Science database.
   Funding acknowledgments are present in two thirds of Spanish articles,
   with significant differences by subject area, number of authors, impact
   factor of journals, and, in one specific area, basic/applied nature of
   research. Second, the existence of specific acknowledgment patterns in
   English-language papers of Spanish researchers in 4 selected subject
   categories (cardiac and cardiovascular systems, economics, evolutionary
   biology, and statistics and probability) is explored through a
   combination of text mining and multivariate analyses. Peer interactive
   communication predominates in the more theoretical or social-oriented
   fields (statistics and probability, economics), whereas the recognition
   of technical assistance is more common in experimental research
   (evolutionary biology), and the mention of potential conflicts of
   interest emerges forcefully in the clinical field (cardiac and
   cardiovascular systems). The systematic inclusion of structured data
   about acknowledgments in journal articles and bibliographic databases
   would have a positive impact on the study of collaboration practices in
   science.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, ecology and sustainable development are priority government's
   actions. In Europe, and more specifically in France, sustainable
   development (SD) is generally broken down into several distinct
   evaluation criteria. Each criterion is a requirement imposed by the
   government and corresponds to strategic stakes. When SD improvement
   actions are financed in an economic region or a city of the French
   territory by the government, a set of measures is usually set up to
   assess and control the impact of these actions. More precisely, these
   measures are used to check whether the region or the city has
   efficiently invested its budget in respect to the SD strategy of the
   government. This assessment process is a complex task for the
   government. Indeed, evaluations are only based on reports provided by
   the financed regions. These very numerous reports are written in natural
   language and thus, it is a thorny and time-consuming task for the
   government to efficiently identify the meaningful information in a
   plethora of reports and then objectively assess all the expected
   priorities. This project aims at automating the assessment process from
   the huge corpus of documents. Text-mining and segmentation techniques
   are introduced to automatically quantify the attention the region or the
   city pays to a given criterion. Obviously, this quantification can only
   be imprecisely determined. Then, the possibility theory is used to merge
   the information related to each criterion prioritization from all the
   documents. Finally, an application on the 265 largest cities in France
   shows the potential of the approach.},

Title = {Online sentiment towards iconic species},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Studies assessing online public sentiment towards biodiversity
   conservation are almost non-existent. The use of social media data and
   other online data sources is increasing in conservation science. We
   collected social media and online news data pertaining to rhinoceros,
   which are iconic species especially threatened by illegal wildlife
   trade, and assessed online sentiment towards these species using natural
   language processing methods. We also used an outlier detection technique
   to identify the most prominent conservation-related events imprinted
   into this data. We found that tragic events, such as the death of the
   last male northern white rhinoceros, Sudan, in March 2018, triggered the
   strongest reactions, which appeared to be concentrated in western
   countries, outside rhinoceros range states. We also found a strong
   temporal cross-correlation between social media data volume and online
   news volume in relation to tragic events, while other events only
   appeared in either social media or online news. Our results highlight
   that the public is concerned about biodiversity loss and this, in turn,
   can be used to increase pressure on decision makers to develop adequate
   conservation actions that can help reverse the biodiversity crisis. The
   proposed methods and analyses can be used to infer sentiment towards any
   biodiversity topic from digital media data, and to detect which events
   are perceived most important to the public.},

Abstract = {Network ecology holds great promise as an approach to modelling and
   predicting the effects of agricultural management on ecosystem service
   provision, as it bridges the gap between community and ecosystem
   ecology. Unfortunately, trophic interactions between most species in
   agricultural farmland are not well characterised empirically, and only
   partial food webs are available for a few systems. Large agricultural
   datasets of the nodes (i.e., species) in the webs are now available, and
   if these can be enriched with information on the links between them then
   the current shortage of network data can potentially be overcome. We
   demonstrate that a logic-based machine learning method can be used to
   automatically assign interactions between nodes, thereby generating
   plausible and testable food webs from ecological census data. Many of
   the learned trophic links were corroborated by the literature: in
   particular, links ascribed with high probability by machine learning
   corresponded with those having multiple references in the literature. In
   some cases, previously unobserved but high probability links were
   suggested and subsequently confirmed by other research groups. We
   evaluate these food webs using a new cross-validation method and present
   new results on automatic corroboration of a large, complex food web. The
   simulated frequencies of trophic links were also correlated with the
   total number of literature `hits' for these links from the automatic
   corroboration. Finally, we also show that a network constructed by
   learning trophic links between functional groups is at least as accurate
   as the species-based trophic network.},

Abstract = {The necessity of developing more powerful and convenient formal means

   meanings of natural language (NL) texts and-building ontologies is
   grounded. The basic principles of an original mathematical approach to
   this problem are outlined; this approach is given by the the theory of
   K-calculuses and K-languages (the KCL-theory) elaborated by the author.
   The considered examples of building semantic representations of the
   NL-texts, of constructing definitions of concepts, and of finding an
   answer to a question of the end user pertain to biology, medicine,
   ecology, and business. The advantages of the KCL-theory in comparison
   with Discourse Representation Theory, Theory of Conceptual Graphs, and
   Episodic Logic are stated. It is reported about a number of successful
   applications of the KCL-theory to the design of NL-processing systems.
   The metaphor ``a kitchen combine{''} is used for underlining that-the
   KCL-theory provides a broad spectrum of new opportunities for the design
   of NL-processing systems and building ontologies.},

Abstract = {We reviewed the texts from 22,179 publications in journals published in

   relative use of terms and identified temporal trends and research
   collaborations using text-mining methods. Terms concerning ecological
   topics at the population level such as structure, function, and
   competition and terms relating to the influences of environmental
   factors were frequently used throughout this century. Relative use of
   higher hierarchical levels (i.e., ecosystem, landscape) has rapidly
   increased, but the use of population and community was stable. Research
   collaboration networks revealed geographically concentrated clusters at
   the organizational level. To understand global-scale ecosystem processes
   and responses, multinational collaboration in ecological fields should
   increase. Our review further demonstrates the importance of conserving
   historical ecological texts as they reflect the attitude of the
   ecological community toward academic concepts over time.},

Abstract = {National parks are key for conserving biodiversity and supporting
   people's well-being. However, anthropogenic pressures challenge the
   existence of national parks and their conservation effectiveness.
   Therefore, it is crucial to assess how people perceive national parks in
   order to enhance socio-political support for conservation.
   User-generated data shared by visitors on social media provide
   opportunities to understand how people perceive (e.g. preferences,
   feelings, opinions) national parks during nature-based recreational
   experiences. In this study, we applied methods from automated natural
   language processing to assess visitors' sentiment when describing
   experiences in Instagram posts geolocated inside four national parks in
   South Africa. We found that visitors' sentiment was positive, and mostly
   included emotions such as joy, anticipation, trust and surprise, with
   only a small occurrence of posts with negative feelings. Appreciation of
   nature, in association with a diverse set of other aspects, such as
   activities, geographical features and tourist attractions, was used to
   describe experiences related to nature, wilderness, travelling, holidays
   and adventures. The type of nature-based experience described by
   visitors was park specific, revealing different profiles of parks
   providing wildlife or scenery experiences. Findings support and
   highlight the societal role of national parks in providing visitors with
   opportunities to develop positive connections with nature. Social media
   data may be used to understand visitors' perceptions, and how the image
   of national parks is constructed by users in the virtual social
   environment. This may help inform management for promoting a
   high-quality tourism experience, as well as conservation marketing aimed
   at fostering socio-political support for national parks and their
   long-term conservation effectiveness.

Title = {Stakeholder involvement in collaborative regulatory processes: Using

Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {219-237},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Regulation increasingly mandates collaborative approaches to increase
   stakeholder input and streamline approval processes. However,
   understanding how to maintain stakeholder involvement over the course of
   a long collaborative process is vital to optimize effectiveness. This
   paper observes more than 700 stakeholders involved in developing and
   implementing a dam operating license over 16 years. We use text mining
   and Bayesian hierarchical modeling to observe meeting attendance and
   recorded actions in meeting minutes. We find that involvement decreased
   after the initial planning phase, but steadily increased through license
   development and implementation. After the regulatory mandate to consult
   with external stakeholders dissolved, overall attendance declined while
   attendance stability increased, meaning that the non-mandatory stage
   involved a smaller cadre of dedicated actors. This indicates that
   high-performing mandated stakeholder involvement processes rely on a
   constrained group of conveners to sustain interaction and have less
   turnover than what might be expected given existing evidence from
   grassroots involvement; assumptions about group dynamics based on
   involvement in grassroots processes may lead to improper predictions
   about who will participate, and how, in processes where stakeholder
   involvement is mandated.},

Abstract = {Purpose of the research: To identify the gaps between the rhetoric and
   reality of the role of citizen participation and its role in maintenance
   and monitoring of heritages and resources (including biodiversity
   monitoring), we analyzed the discourse of Globally Important
   Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) at municipality level. Methods: As
   an analytical framework, text mining is applied to interviews of
   officers at the municipal level of GIAHS in Noto which was amongst the
   first sites in Japan. The identification of such gap is critical for
   sustainability and to prevent conflicts from tourism, agriculture or
   educations. Results: The results reveal that (1) there is a gap between
   the official goals of that designation at the international level and
   local needs, (2) role of citizens is emphasized in the applications and
   action plans at rhetorical level but remain rather limited in practice
   and that (3) municipalities composing the GIAHS often have different
   priorities, even within the very same GIAHS sites, some municipalities
   even calling themselves ``just a transition point to other destination
   municipalities.{''} Conclusions: It is critical for municipal ocers to
   collaborate with various stakeholders, especially citizens. As such,
   citizen science is a bottom-up approach to promote biodiversity
   conservation and facilitate GIAHS managements.},

Abstract = {For a scientific discipline to be interdisciplinary, it must satisfy two
   conditions; it must consist of contributions from at least two existing
   disciplines, and it must be able to provide insights, through this
   interaction, that neither progenitor discipline could address. In this
   study, I examine the complete body of peer-reviewed literature
   self-identified as landscape genetics (LG) using the statistical
   approaches of text mining and natural language processing. The goal here
   was to quantify the kinds of questions being addressed in LG studies,
   the ways in which questions are evaluated mechanistically, and how they
   are differentiated from the progenitor disciplines of landscape ecology
   and population genetics. I then circumscribe the main factions within
   published LG studies examining the extent to which emergent questions
   are being addressed and highlighting a deep bifurcation between existing
   individual- and population-based approaches. I close by providing some
   suggestions on where theoretical and analytical work is needed if LGs is
   to serve as a real bridge connecting evolution and ecology sensu lato.},

Abstract = {A global crisis for production landscapes has shed light on the
   importance of sustainable management of these landscapes in an
   integrated manner at local and national levels. However, there is a lack

   Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans (NBSAPs) of 133 Convention on
   Biological Diversity parties using a text mining method to determine the
   current global situation regarding production landscape policies. The
   statistical results showed that (1) about half of parties mentioned
   integrated approaches in production landscapes (e.g., cultural
   landscapes, socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes), (2)
   there were some regional differences in the number of references, (3)
   the introduction of these concepts has been increasing worldwide, and
   (4) these concepts have been accorded higher priority in national policy

Title = {Introducing Explorer of Taxon Concepts with a case study on spider
   measurement matrix building},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Background: Taxonomic descriptions are traditionally composed in natural
   language and published in a format that cannot be directly used by
   computers. The Exploring Taxon Concepts (ETC) project has been
   developing a set of web-based software tools that convert morphological
   descriptions published in telegraphic style to character data that can
   be reused and repurposed. This paper introduces the first semi-automated
   pipeline, to our knowledge, that converts morphological descriptions
   into taxon-character matrices to support systematics and evolutionary
   biology research. We then demonstrate and evaluate the use of the ETC
   Input Creation - Text Capture - Matrix Generation pipeline to generate
   body part measurement matrices from a set of 188 spider morphological
   descriptions and report the findings.
   Results: From the given set of spider taxonomic publications, two
   versions of input (original and normalized) were generated and used by
   the ETC Text Capture and ETC Matrix Generation tools. The tools produced
   two corresponding spider body part measurement matrices, and the matrix
   from the normalized input was found to be much more similar to a gold
   standard matrix hand-curated by the scientist co-authors. Special
   conventions utilized in the original descriptions (e.g., the omission of
   measurement units) were attributed to the lower performance of using the
   original input. The results show that simple normalization of the
   description text greatly increased the quality of the machine-generated
   matrix and reduced edit effort. The machine-generated matrix also helped
   identify issues in the gold standard matrix.
   Conclusions: ETC Text Capture and ETC Matrix Generation are low-barrier
   and effective tools for extracting measurement values from spider
   taxonomic descriptions and are more effective when the descriptions are
   self-contained. Special conventions that make the description text less
   self contained challenge automated extraction of data from biodiversity
   descriptions and hinder the automated reuse of the published knowledge.
   The tools will be updated to support new requirements revealed in this
   case study.},

Abstract = {This research responds to the needs for concentric diversification by
   focusing on how firms can find new business opportunities based on their
   technological capabilities. We propose a systematic approach to
   identifying potential areas for concentric diversification at a product
   level via link analysis of products and technologies. For this, first,
   text mining is utilised to construct an integrated patent-product
   database from the US patent and trademark database. Second, association
   rule mining is employed to construct a product ecology network using
   directed technological relationships between products. Third, a link
   prediction analysis is conducted to identify potential areas for
   concentric diversification at a product level. Finally, three
   quantitative indicators are developed to assess the characteristics of
   the areas identified. Our case study employs a total of 850,676 patents
   and 328,288 products in the integrated patent-product database from 2010
   to 2014 and shows that the proposed approach enables a wide-ranging
   search for potential areas for concentric diversification and the quick
   assessment of their characteristics, with statistically significant
   results. We believe that the proposed approach will be useful as a
   complementary tool for decision making for small and medium-sized
   high-tech companies that are considering entering new business areas,
   but which have little domain knowledge. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Sustainability transition projects (STPs) employ specialist knowledge
   and learning to lever changes for the communities with which they
   engage. Research into these forms of organizations often focuses on
   engagement practices and their relative success or failure to facilitate
   local transitions toward sustainability. What has attracted
   comparatively less attention, however, is how STPs develop their own
   sense of expertise in this role as a broker of Mode-2 knowledge or their
   own understanding about what it is that they are doing in facilitating
   community-scale changes. Privileging an emphasis on language-in-use
   research in organizational theory, this study analyzed the
   transcriptions of facilitated action research (AR) meetings of a case
   study STP by applying text mining methods in conjunction with a thematic
   analysis, the latter exploring insights gained across themes of
   governance, delivery, networks, challenges, and learning. The findings
   from these analyses are discussed with reference to how the case study
   STP staff group construes their work in the domain of sustainability and
   the generation and acquisition of relevant knowledge and learning in
   this specialized subsector of community development.},

Abstract = {Species traits are a new data currency to enhance our understanding of
   ecological patterns and processes. Trait-based studies of fishes are
   numerous in comparison with other animal groups, reflecting the
   diversity of fish forms and functions they provide to aquatic
   ecosystems. We conduct a retrospective examination of literature to
   identify knowledge gaps and provide guidance for future research in
   trait-based fish ecology. We apply an automated text mining and topic
   modelling to track the evolution of research topics within peer-reviewed
   articles of functional traits in marine and freshwater fishes published
   over the past half century, explore the inter-connections among those
   topics and identify emerging avenues for investigation. By mapping the
   topic landscape of the literature, 16 latent topics emerged that vary in
   their prevalence. Our results show a decline in the frequency of studies
   using reproductive traits to model and explore the way fish allocate
   energy for reproduction, and increase in studies reporting functional
   diversity metrics and utilizing the concept of multivariate functional
   space. Research focused on contributions of fish traits to ecosystem
   functioning also has increased in frequency. We revealed large gaps in
   information between growing and decreasing topics and that these gaps
   were derived from different types of traits being considered. We suggest
   that scientists break-free from the traditions of their research field
   by targeting investigations that: (a) apply functional diversity metrics
   to a broader assortment of traits, (b) focus on traits influencing
   energy allocation to growth/reproduction and (c) integrate trophic-web
   and behavioural studies with other topics.},

Abstract = {The Ecological Society of Australia was founded in 1959, and the
   society's journal was first published in 1976. To examine how research
   published in the society's journal has changed over this time, we used
   text mining to quantify themes and trends in the body of work published
   by theAustralian Journal of EcologyandAustral Ecologyfrom 1976 to 2019.
   We used topic models to identify 30 `topics' within 2778 full-text
   articles in 246 issues of the journal, followed by mixed modelling to
   identify topics with above-average or below-average popularity in terms
   of the number of publications or citations that they contain. We found
   high inter-decadal turnover in research topics, with an early emphasis
   on highly specific ecosystems or processes giving way to a modern
   emphasis on community, spatial and fire ecology, invasive species and
   statistical modelling. Despite an early focus on Australian research,
   papers discussing South American ecosystems are now among the
   fastest-growing and most frequently cited topics in the journal. Topics
   that were growing fastest in publication rates were not always the same
   as those with high citation rates. Our results provide a systematic
   breakdown of the topics thatAustral Ecologyauthors and editors have
   chosen to research, publish and cite through time, providing a valuable
   window into the historical and emerging foci of the journal.},

Title = {Fast, scalable, and automated identification of articles for

Abstract = {Aim Understanding broad-scale ecological patterns and processes is
   necessary if we are to mitigate the consequences of anthropogenically
   driven biodiversity degradation. However, such analyses require large
   datasets and current data collation methods can be slow, involving
   extensive human input. Given rapid and ever-increasing rates of
   scientific publication, manually identifying data sources among hundreds
   of thousands of articles is a significant challenge, which can create a
   bottleneck in the generation of ecological databases.
   Innovation Here, we demonstrate the use of general, text-classification
   approaches to identify relevant biodiversity articles. We apply this to
   two freely available example databases, the Living Planet Database and
   the database of the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological
   Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) project, both of which
   underpin important biodiversity indicators. We assess machine-learning
   classifiers based on logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural
   networks, and identify aspects of the text-processing workflow that
   influence classification performance.
   Main conclusions Our best classifiers can distinguish relevant from
   non-relevant articles with over 90\% accuracy. Using readily available
   abstracts and titles or abstracts alone produces significantly better
   results than using titles alone. LR and neural network models performed
   similarly. Crucially, we show that deploying such models on real-world
   search results can significantly increase the rate at which potentially
   relevant papers are recovered compared to a current manual protocol.
   Furthermore, our results indicate that, given a modest initial sample of
   100 relevant papers, high-performing classifiers could be generated
   quickly through iteratively updating the training texts based on
   targeted literature searches. These findings clearly demonstrate the
   usefulness of text-mining methods for constructing and enhancing
   ecological datasets, and wider application of these techniques has the
   potential to benefit large-scale analyses more broadly. We provide
   source code and examples that can be used to create new classifiers for
   other datasets.},

Title = {Semi-automatic Extraction of Plants Morphological Characters from
   Taxonomic Descriptions Written in Spanish},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {Taxonomic literature keeps records of the planet's biodiversity and
   gives access to the knowledge needed for its sustainable management.
   Unfortunately, most of the taxonomic information is available in
   scientific publications in text format. The amount of publications
   generated is very large; therefore, to process it in order to obtain
   high structured texts would be complex and very expensive. Approaches
   like citizen science may help the process by selecting whole fragments
   of texts dealing with morphological descriptions; but a deeper analysis,
   compatible with accepted ontologies, will require specialised tools. The
   Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) estimates that there are more than
   120 million pages published in over 5.4 million books since 1469, plus
   about 800,000 monographs and 40,000 journal titles (12,500 of these are
   current titles).
   It is necessary to develop standards and software tools to extract,
   integrate and publish this information into existing free and open
   access repositories of biodiversity knowledge to support science,
   education and biodiversity conservation.
   This document presents an algorithm based on computational linguistics
   techniques to extract structured information from morphological
   descriptions of plants written in Spanish. The developed algorithm is
   based on the work of Dr. Hong Cui from the University of Arizona; it
   uses semantic analysis, ontologies and a repository of knowledge
   acquired from the same descriptions. The algorithm was applied to the
   books Trees of Costa Rica Volume III (TCRv3), Trees of Costa Rica Volume
   IV (TCRv4) and to a subset of descriptions of the Manual of Plants of
   Costa Rica (MPCR) with very competitive results (more than 92.5\% of
   average performance). The system receives the morphological descriptions
   in tabular format and generates XML documents. The XML schema allows
   documenting structures, characters and relations between characters and
   structures. Each extracted object is associated with attributes like
   name, value, modifiers, restrictions, ontology term id, amongst other
   attributes.
   The implemented tool is free software. It was developed using Java and
   integrates existing technology as FreeLing, the Plant Ontology (PO), the
   Plant Glossary, the Ontology Term Organizer (OTO) and the Flora
   Mesoamericana English-Spanish Glossary.},

Title = {An automated approach to identifying search terms for systematic reviews

Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1645-1654},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Systematic review, meta-analysis and other forms of evidence synthesis
   are critical to strengthen the evidence base concerning conservation
   issues and to answer ecological and evolutionary questions. Synthesis
   lags behind the pace of scientific publishing, however, due to time and
   resource costs which partial automation of evidence synthesis tasks
   could reduce. Additionally, current methods of retrieving evidence for
   synthesis are susceptible to bias towards studies with which researchers
   are familiar. In fields that lack standardized terminology encoded in an
   ontology, including ecology and evolution, research teams can
   unintentionally exclude articles from the review by omitting synonymous
   phrases in their search terms. To combat these problems, we developed a
   quick, objective, reproducible method for generating search strategies
   that uses text mining and keyword co-occurrence networks to identify the
   most important terms for a review. The method reduces bias in search
   strategy development because it does not rely on a predetermined set of
   articles and can improve search recall by identifying synonymous terms
   that research teams might otherwise omit. When tested against the search
   strategies used in published environmental systematic reviews, our
   method performs as well as the published searches and retrieves
   gold-standard hits that replicated versions of the original searches do
   not. Because the method is quasi-automated, the amount of time required
   to develop a search strategy, conduct searches, and assemble results is
   reduced from approximately 17-34 hr to under 2 hr. To facilitate use of
   the method for environmental evidence synthesis, we implemented the
   method in the R package litsearchr, which also contains a suite of
   functions to improve efficiency of systematic reviews by automatically
   deduplicating and assembling results from separate databases.},

Abstract = {Sustainability is an important concept for society, economics, and the
   environment, with thousands of research papers published on the subject
   annually. As sustainability science becomes a distinctive research
   field, it is important to define sustainability clearly and grasp the
   entire structure, current status, and future directions of
   sustainability science. This paper provides an academic landscape of
   sustainability science by analyzing the citation network of papers
   published in academic journals. A topological clustering method is used
   to detect the sub-domains of sustainability science. Results show the
   existence of 15 main research clusters: Agriculture, Fisheries,
   Ecological Economics, Forestry (agroforestry), Forestry (tropical rain
   forest), Business, Tourism, Water, Forestry (biodiversity), Urban
   Planning, Rural Sociology, Energy, Health, Soil, and Wildlife.
   Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, and Forestry
   (agroforestry) clusters are predominant among these. The Energy cluster
   is currently developing, as indicated by the age of papers in the
   cluster, although it has a relatively small number of papers. These
   results are compared with those obtained by natural language processing.
   Education, Biotechnology, Medical, Livestock, Climate Change, Welfare,
   and Livelihood clusters are uniquely extracted by natural language
   processing, because they are common topics across clusters in the
   citation network.},

Abstract = {Protection of the environment and specially protected natural
   territories are in the joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and
   its constituent entities. In particular, constituent entities have the
   power to establish their own categories of specially protected natural
   territories (called regional categories) besides the categories
   prescribed by the federal law On Specially Protected Natural
   Territories. The diversity of regional categories has been studied only
   superficially, despite the fact that such research may be valuable for
   finding out the drawbacks of federal and regional legislation and for
   identifying the ways it can be improved. It may also result in general
   insights about Russian lawmaking under joint jurisdiction. The study
   presented in this paper aimed to find the regularities in the
   legislative activity of Russia's constituent entities in the field of
   establishing regional categories. For this purpose, the full list of
   regional categories as of August 1, 2019 was made and then processed
   with text mining algorithms, including word clouds, bigram analysis,
   word correlations, and clustering of categories' names using their
   vector representations made with Fasttext. Several large groups of
   regional categories were determined as a result: protected natural
   objects (analogous to natural monuments), protected landscapes and
   natural complexes, protected green zones of populated localities,
   recreational areas, and areas of historical and cultural designation,
   which are similar to cultural heritage objects. Some constituent
   entities fill the gaps in federal regulation; they follow the paradigm
   of anticipatory lawmaking and provide for special rules for territories
   under international agreements, such as wetlands of international
   importance, or they partially implement protected area categories
   adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. However,
   some regional categories are likely to indicate a low level of legal
   technique in regional lawmaking. This analysis of regional categories
   points out three deficiencies of the Russian federal legislation on
   protected areas: instability of legislation, excessive rigidity of the
   federal categories system, and flaws in the protection of areas valuable
   for conservation of biodiversity, recreation, and support for ecological
   balance.},

Abstract = {Natural history offers an interestingly rich mix of traditional and
   modern ways of organizing data, information, and knowledge. The Linnaean
   tradition still defines the basis of how taxonomic knowledge of
   organisms is organized, while at the same time complementary
   perspectives on databases and ontologies are developed and implemented,
   to provide enhanced access to natural history collection data to
   researchers in taxonomy and biodiversity. Some of this knowledge
   enrichment may even be automated, and boot-strapped from basic object
   metadata. This metadata is largely composed of natural language text,
   which is generally more noisy and ambiguous than numeric data. In this
   contribution, we present two methods for the automated discovery of
   metadata from textual object databases: first, the automatic detection
   of new metadata in existing free-text database columns, and second, the
   discovery of new ontological relations between metadata elements.},

Abstract = {Between 1987 and 1995, research papers published in five leading
   journals of applied ecology and conservation biology (AECB) were
   overwhelmingly produced by American and British authors. A significant
   proportion of overall variation in research productivity among nations
   could be explained by differences in gross national product (GNP). Here,
   we used bibliometric analyses for a comparative assessment to determine
   if geographical patterns of research changed or remained consistent
   between the periods, 1987-1995 and 2007-2015. Our results revealed an
   absence of a marked increase in geographical diversity of research.
   Imbalances persisted in global research efforts in five leading
   journals, with research productivity remaining significantly correlated
   to national differences in wealth. There is a disparity between where
   scientific research continues to be conducted and where hotspots of
   biodiversity are known to exist as indicated by our study and several
   other recent papers. This is an alarming finding as research is needed
   to establish conservation status, and work by others shows that the
   level of conservation spending is significantly correlated with
   mitigating biodiversity loss and improving species at risk status.},

Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2012},
Number = {209, SI},
Pages = {235-253},
Abstract = {Part diary, part scientific record, biological field notebooks often
   contain details necessary to understanding the location and
   environmental conditions existent during collecting events. Despite
   their clear value for (and recent use in) global change studies, the
   text-mining outputs from field notebooks have been idiosyncratic to
   specific research projects, and impossible to discover or re-use. Best
   practices and workflows for digitization, transcription, extraction, and
   integration with other sources are nascent or non-existent. In this
   paper, we demonstrate a workflow to generate structured outputs while
   also maintaining links to the original texts. The first step in this
   workflow was to place already digitized and transcribed field notebooks
   from the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History founder,
   Junius Henderson, on Wildsource, an open text transcription platform.
   Next, we created Wildsource templates to document places, dates, and
   taxa to facilitate annotation and wild-linking. We then requested help
   from the public, through social media tools, to take advantage of
   volunteer efforts and energy. After three notebooks were fully
   annotated, content was converted into XML and annotations were extracted
   and cross-walked into Darwin Core compliant record sets. Finally, these
   recordsets were vetted, to provide valid taxon names, via a process we
   call ``taxonomic referencing.{''} The result is identification and
   mobilization of 1,068 observations from three of Henderson's thirteen
   notebooks and a publishable Darwin Core record set for use in other
   analyses. Although challenges remain, this work demonstrates a feasible
   approach to unlock observations from field notebooks that enhances their
   discovery and interoperability without losing the narrative context from
   which those observations are drawn.},

Abstract = {Esperanto is a constructed natural language, which was intended to be an
   easy-to-learn lingua franca. Zipf's law models the statistical
   proportions of various phenomena in human ecology, including natural
   languages. Given Esperanto's artificial origins, one wonders how
   ``natural{''} it appears, relative to other natural languages, in the
   context of Zipf's law. To explore this question, we collected a total of
   283 books from six languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish,
   and Esperanto. We applied Zipf-based metrics on our corpus to extract
   distributions for word, word distance, word bigram, word trigram, and
   word length for each book. Statistical analyses show that Esperanto's
   statistical proportions are similar to those of other languages. We then
   trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify books according to
   language. The ANNs achieved high accuracy rates (86.3\% to 98.6\%).
   Subsequent analysis identified German as having the most unique
   proportions, followed by Esperanto, Italian, Spanish, English, and
   French. Analysis of misclassified patterns shows that Esperanto's
   statistical proportions resemble mostly those of German and Spanish, and
   least those of French and Italian.},

Abstract = {Documented occurrences of fossil taxa are the empirical foundation for
   understanding large-scale biodiversity changes and evolutionary dynamics
   in deep time. The fossil record contains vast amounts of understudied
   taxa. Yet the compilation of huge volumes of data remains a
   labour-intensive impediment to a more complete understanding of Earth's
   biodiversity history. Even so, many occurrence records of species and
   genera in these taxa can be uncovered in the palaeontological
   literature. Here, we extract observations of fossils and their inferred
   ages from unstructured text in books and scientific articles using
   machine-learning approaches. We use Bryozoa, a group of marine
   invertebrates with a rich fossil record, as a case study. Building on
   recent advances in computational linguistics, we develop a pipeline to
   recognize taxonomic names and geologic time intervals in published
   literature and use supervised learning to machine-read whether the
   species in question occurred in a given age interval. Intermediate
   machine error rates appear comparable to human error rates in a simple
   trial, and resulting genus richness curves capture the main features of
   published fossil diversity studies of bryozoans. We believe our
   automated pipeline, that greatly reduced the time required to compile
   our dataset, can help others compile similar data for other taxa.},

Title = {Research hotspots and current challenges of lakes and reservoirs: a
   bibliometric analysis},

Volume = {124},

Abstract = {Despite covering a small portion of the earth's surface, lakes and
   reservoirs offer enormous benefits to human society, environmental
   well-being, and economic welfare. Previous studies have provided
   insights into specific subjects, yet integrated perspectives on the
   development of the two waterbodies are missing. To this end, we
   conducted a bibliometric analysis as a systematic data gathering to
   perform a large-scale overview and assess global trends of their
   scientific publications. Moreover, a second goal is to differentiate
   their research hotspots and current challenges given the different
   nature of their origin and functionality. 147,811 publications from 1955
   to 2019 were retrieved from the database of the Science Citation Index
   Expanded, and then, divided into four research lines, (1) design and
   operation; (2) environment and ecology; (3) sanitation and human health;
   (4) socioeconomics. Bibliometric indicators showed that the number of
   publications sustained a rapid growth, from 100 during the 1950s to
   around 7800 publications per year during the past few years. The United
   States and EU 28 have long been world leaders in lake and reservoir
   research yet China has tremendously boosted its publications within the
   past 20 years, advancing this nation to the new world leader in both
   categories in 2019. Taking a closer look at research hotspots, design
   and operation have been the main topics for reservoir research while
   environment and ecology topics are the hotspots in lakes-related
   studies. This reflected the intensive human interventions in reservoirs,
   whose major purposes are to supply hydropower energy, irrigation, water
   storage, and aquaculture. Conversely, the impacts of eutrophication,
   heavy metals, and climate change have become more severe with the
   increase of species extinction and biodiversity loss, leading to urgent
   needs for lake restoration. Both freshwater bodies show comparable
   attention on their roles in socioeconomics while much higher concerns
   about sanitation and human health have been paid in reservoirs compared
   to its counterpart. Clear obtained distinctions in the hotspots and
   challenges of lake and reservoir research can contribute to better
   decision support systems of the two waterbodies.},

Title = {Identifying Reliable Opportunistic Data for Species Distribution
   Modeling: A Benchmark Data Optimization Approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to increase the number of species
   occurrence data by integrating opportunistic data with Global
   Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) benchmark data via a novel
   optimization technique. The optimization method utilizes Natural
   Language Processing (NLP) and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to
   maximize the average likelihood of species occurrence in maximum entropy
   presence-only species distribution models (SDM). We applied the
   Kruskal-Wallis test to assess the differences between the corresponding
   environmental variables and habitat suitability indices (HSI) among
   datasets, including data from GBIF, Facebook (FB), and data from
   optimally selected FB data. To quantify uncertainty in SDM predictions,
   and to quantify the efficacy of the proposed optimization procedure, we
   used a bootstrapping approach to generate 1000 subsets from five
   different datasets: (1) GBIF; (2) FB; (3) GBIF plus FB; (4) GBIF plus
   optimally selected FB; and (5) GBIF plus randomly selected FB. We
   compared the performance of simulated species distributions based on
   each of the above subsets via the area under the curve (AUC) of the
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC). We also performed correlation
   analysis between the average benchmark-based SDM outputs and the average
   dataset-based SDM outputs. Median AUCs of SDMs based on the dataset that
   combined benchmark GBIF data and optimally selected FB data were
   generally higher than the AUCs of other datasets, indicating the
   effectiveness of the optimization procedure. Our results suggest that
   the proposed approach increases the quality and quantity of data by
   effectively extracting opportunistic data from large unstructured
   datasets with respect to benchmark data.},

Abstract = {Microorganisms play a vital role in various ecosystems and
   characterizing interactions between them is an essential step towards
   understanding the organization and function of microbial communities.
   Computational prediction has recently become a widely used approach to
   investigate microbial interactions. We provide a thorough review of
   emerging computational methods organized by the type of data they
   employ. We highlight three major challenges in inferring interactions
   using metagenomic survey data and discuss the underlying assumptions and
   mathematics of interaction inference algorithms. In addition, we review
   interaction prediction methods relying on metabolic pathways, which are
   increasingly used to reveal mechanisms of interactions. Furthermore, we
   also emphasize the importance of mining the scientific literature for
   microbial interactions - a largely overlooked data source for
   experimentally validated interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Constructing a biodiversity terminological inventory},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {The increasing growth of literature in biodiversity presents challenges
   to users who need to discover pertinent information in an efficient and
   timely manner. In response, text mining techniques offer solutions by
   facilitating the automated discovery of knowledge from large textual
   data. An important step in text mining is the recognition of concepts
   via their linguistic realisation, i.e., terms. However, a given concept
   may be referred to in text using various synonyms or term variants,
   making search systems likely to overlook documents mentioning less known
   variants, which are albeit relevant to a query term. Domain-specific
   terminological resources, which include term variants, synonyms and
   related terms, are thus important in supporting semantic search over
   large textual archives. This article describes the use of text mining
   methods for the automatic construction of a large-scale biodiversity
   term inventory. The inventory consists of names of species, amongst
   which naming variations are prevalent. We apply a number of
   distributional semantic techniques on all of the titles in the
   Biodiversity Heritage Library, to compute semantic similarity between
   species names and support the automated construction of the resource.
   With the construction of our biodiversity term inventory, we demonstrate
   that distributional semantic models are able to identify semantically
   similar names that are not yet recorded in existing taxonomies. Such
   methods can thus be used to update existing taxonomies
   semi-automatically by deriving semantically related taxonomic names from
   a text corpus and allowing expert curators to validate them. We also
   evaluate our inventory as a means to improve search by facilitating
   automatic query expansion. Specifically, we developed a visual search
   interface that suggests semantically related species names, which are
   available in our inventory but not always in other repositories, to
   incorporate into the search query. An assessment of the interface by
   domain experts reveals that our query expansion based on related names
   is useful for increasing the number of relevant documents retrieved. Its
   exploitation can benefit both users and developers of search engines and
   text mining applications.},

Title = {Content analysis of resilience in forest fire science and management},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {To better understand the implications of the word resilience for western
   forest and fire management, this study explores its emerging use in a
   large body of policy and management documents produced between 1980 and
   2016. We performed a computer-aided content analysis on 1487 scientific
   journal articles and 139 western U.S. Forest Service USFS planning
   documents to answer three questions: 1 how has the use-rate of the word
   resilience changed over time? 2 are changes in the use-rate of the word
   resilience correlated with shifts in terminology associated with
   environmental values, complex systems theory, or environmental change?
   and, (3) how does the use of the word resilience compare between science
   and management documents? To ground our interpretations in the context
   of the word's technical use, we conducted 25 semi-structured interviews
   with scientists and managers working across the region. We found that
   the word resilience has been used in these documents since the 1980s but
   that its use sharply increased in both contexts between 2009 and 2011.
   The use-rate trends differ between science and management documents and
   do not appear to be associated complex systems terms but do seem
   associated with increases in the use of terms ``climate change{''} and
   ``adapt{''} and biocentric values. Finally, although there are
   differences in how resilience is used between science and management
   documents, the shared meaning of the term is a hopeful framing for
   adapting forests to changing conditions. Understanding the emerging use
   of the word resilience is of critical importance for land use policies
   that rely on it to signify a central concept, strategy or goal.},

Title = {Using industrial ecology and strategic management concepts to pursue the
   Sustainable Development Goals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {237-246},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {The subjectivity, complexity, and often competing interests of
   sustainable development have limited the effectiveness of integrating
   these important ideas into mainstream business strategy. With the
   adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in January 2016,
   there are now global sustainability benchmarks that apply across diverse
   sectors and national contexts, allowing public and private organizations
   to orient and evaluate their activities, strategies, and business
   outcomes. However, it is not directly apparent where the advantage for
   business lies in pursuit of these actions within the prevailing economic
   paradigm, highlighting the need for new analytical frameworks and tools.
   Industrial ecology (IE) has been successfully used in engineering
   practice for decades and has been suggested as a method that can provide
   the concepts and methods necessary to bridge the gap between traditional
   business practice and sustainable development. To test this, literature
   bridging the fields of industrial ecology, business strategy, and
   sustainable development was collected and analyzed using the textual
   analysis software Leximancer (TM). The analysis showed that while the
   SDGs are primarily aimed at the national level, they also hold relevance
   for business through innovation, partnerships, and strategic
   positioning, inter alia. The analysis found that the integration of IE
   and business strategy is highly relevant for three of the SDGs, but
   captures elements of all 17 to varying degrees. IE has a strong focus on
   innovation and its potential in new markets, products, and business
   models. IE is also consciously aimed at the efficient use of energy and
   resources, ideas that are relevant to mitigating, adapting, and building
   resilience in a changing future, but are also relevant to traditional
   concepts of business strategy and competitive advantage. This paper
   shows that through the combination of IE and strategic management
   theory, commercial organizations can positively contribute to the
   Sustainable Development Goals while building competitive advantage. (C)

Title = {COPIOUS: A gold standard corpus of named entities towards extracting
   species occurrence from biodiversity literature},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Background
   Species occurrence records are very important in the biodiversity
   domain. While several available corpora contain only annotations of
   species names or habitats and geographical locations, there is no
   consolidated corpus that covers all types of entities necessary for
   extracting species occurrence from biodiversity literature. In order to
   alleviate this issue, we have constructed the COPIOUS corpus-a gold
   standard corpus that covers a wide range of biodiversity entities.
   Results
   Two annotators manually annotated the corpus with five categories of
   entities, i.e. taxon names, geographical locations, habitats, temporal
   expressions and person names. The overall inter-annotator agreement on
   200 doubly-annotated documents is approximately 81.86\% F-score. Amongst
   the five categories, the agreement on habitat entities was the lowest,
   indicating that this type of entity is complex. The COPIOUS corpus
   consists of 668 documents downloaded from the Biodiversity Heritage
   Library with over 26K sentences and more than 28K entities. Named entity
   recognisers trained on the corpus could achieve an F-score of 74.58\%.
   Moreover, in recognising taxon names, our model performed better than
   two available tools in the biodiversity domain, namely the SPECIES
   tagger and the Global Name Recognition and Discovery. More than 1,600
   binary relations of Taxon-Habitat, Taxon-Person, Taxon-Geographical
   locations and Taxon-Temporal expressions were identified by applying a
   pattern-based relation extraction system to the gold standard. Based on
   the extracted relations, we can produce a knowledge repository of
   species occurrences.
   Conclusion
   The paper describes in detail the construction of a gold standard named
   entity corpus for the biodiversity domain. An investigation of the
   performance of named entity recognition (NER) tools trained on the gold
   standard revealed that the corpus is sufficiently reliable and sizeable
   for both training and evaluation purposes. The corpus can be further
   used for relation extraction to locate species occurrences in
   literature-a useful task for monitoring species distribution and
   preserving the biodiversity.},

Abstract = {We propose a novel multivariate method to analyse biodiversity data
   based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. LDA, a
   probabilistic model, reduces assemblages to sets of distinct component
   communities. It produces easily interpretable results, can represent
   abrupt and gradual changes in composition, accommodates missing data and
   allows for coherent estimates of uncertainty. We illustrate our method
   using tree data for the eastern United States and from a tropical
   successional chronosequence. The model is able to detect pervasive
   declines in the oak community in Minnesota and Indiana, potentially due
   to fire suppression, increased growing season precipitation and
   herbivory. The chronosequence analysis is able to delineate clear
   successional trends in species composition, while also revealing that
   site-specific factors significantly impact these successional
   trajectories. The proposed method provides a means to decompose and
   track the dynamics of species assemblages along temporal and spatial
   gradients, including effects of global change and forest disturbances.},

Abstract = {Increasing globalization creates situations with wide-ranging effects on
   large communities, often requiring global responses and innovative
   solutions. Timely examples are climate and environmental changes related
   to rapid growth and economic development. Natural and man-made
   unforeseen catastrophes like oil spills, landslides and floods require
   immediate action that might crucially rely on information and expertise
   available only from sources far removed from the crisis site. Knowledge
   sharing and transfer are also essential for sustainable long-term growth
   and development. In both kinds of cases, it is important that
   information and experience be made available and widely shared,
   communicated and encoded for future re-use. The global scope of many
   problems and their solutions requires furthermore that information and
   communication be accessible to communities crossing languages and
   cultures. Finally, an appropriate system for recording, maintaining and
   sharing information must be accessible to both experts and laymen.
   The goal of the European Union-funded KYOTO project (Knowledge-Yielding
   Ontologies for Transition-Based Organization,
   http://www.kyoto-project.eu) is to develop an information and knowledge
   sharing system that relates documents in several languages to lexical
   resources and a common central ontology and allows for deep semantic
   analysis. KYOTO facilitates the crosslinguistic and crosscultural
   construction and maintenance of a sophisticated knowledge system among
   the members of domain-specific communities. Representation, storage and
   retrieval of a shared terminology takes place via a Wiki platform.
   Relevant terms are anchored in a language-independent, customizable
   formal ontology that connects the lexicons of seven languages (Basque,
   Chinese, Dutch, English, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish) and that
   guarantees a uniform interpretation of terms across languages. The
   semantic representations in the ontology are accessible to a computer
   and allow deep textual analysis and reasoning operations.
   KYOTO's target domains are the environment and biodiversity, with
   appropriate experts acting as ``users{''}. Once developed, the system
   will be available for extension to any domain.},

Title = {Automated content analysis: addressing the big literature challenge in

Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The exponential growth of scientific literature - which we call the big
   literature' phenomenon - has created great challenges in literature
   comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis
   processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to
   human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new
   literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. In this paper,
   we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated
   content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the
   fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine
   learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big
   literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research.
   Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA
   and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of
   literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and
   summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA
   studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing
   ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to
   maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential
   research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future
   ecological and evolutionary research. Unlike manual methods of
   literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature
   at substantially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human
   biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for
   a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis,
   including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to
   address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive
   and comprehensive reviews of big literature, ACA has the potential to
   fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the
   advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal modelling is an important task for ecology. Social media
   tags have been found to have great potential to assist in predicting
   aspects of the natural environment, particularly through the use of
   machine learning methods. Here we propose a novel spatiotemporal
   embeddings model, called SPATE, which is able to integrate textual
   information from the photo-sharing platform Flickr and structured
   scientific information from more traditional environmental data sources.
   The proposed model can be used for modelling and predicting a wide
   variety of ecological features such as species distribution, as well as
   related phenomena such as climate features. We first propose a new
   method based on spatiotemporal kernel density estimation to handle the
   sparsity of Flickr tag distributions over space and time. Then, we
   efficiently integrate the spatially and temporally smoothed Flickr tags
   with the structured scientific data into low-dimensional vector space
   representations. We experimentally show that our model is able to
   substantially outperform baselines that rely only on Flickr or only on
   traditional sources.},

Abstract = {We propose a method which uses Flickr tags to predict a wide variety of
   environmental features, such as climate data, land cover categories,
   species occurrence, and human assessments of scenicness. The role of
   Flickr tags in our method is two-fold. First, we show that Flickr tags
   capture information which is highly complementary to what is found in
   traditional structured environmental datasets. By combining Flickr tags
   with traditional datasets, we can thus make more accurate predictions
   than is possible using either Flickr tags or traditional datasets alone.
   Second, we propose a collective prediction model which crucially relies
   on Flickr tags to define a neighbourhood structure. The use of a
   collective prediction formulation is motivated by the fact that most
   environmental features are strongly spatially autocorrelated. While this
   suggests that geographic distance should play a key role in determining
   neighbourhoods, we show that considerable gains can be made by
   additionally taking Flickr tags and traditional data into consideration.},

Abstract = {To investigate agents' intelligent acts in a multi-dimensional space and
   analyze their mental status in different granular metric scales or
   affordance, a new concept ecological calculus for multi-agent systems is
   put forward based on essential standpoints of ecology and universal
   logics. Qualitative and quantitative models of ecological calculus for a
   general multi-agent systems' framework are presented based on
   generalized modeling methods for large systems cybernetics. And a use
   case in natural language processing with a generic algorithm is applied
   to prove the validity of the frame. Experiments show that not only does
   the framework help us to understand and interpret many natural phenomena
   such as fuzzy concepts or propositions, but also to solve complex
   agents' interaction problems such as negotiation and competition.},

Abstract = {A business ecosystem provides a new perspective for repositioning a
   company's strategy in order to aggressively further its own interests
   and to promote its overall ecosystem health. Analyzing a business
   ecosystem is not an easy task, and therefore only a few studies have
   been made, even though some scholars and managers accept this concept
   from ecology since value creation is achieved by establishing a platform
   that other members of the ecosystem can use to enhance their
   performance. This paper presents a case study based on both qualitative
   and quantitative data, by explaining how Cisco Systems has been so
   successful in utilizing its strategy of mergers and acquisitions (M\&A)
   for corporate growth based on a business ecosystem, especially from a
   technological perspective. We use US patent data from 1993 to 2005 to
   illustrate Cisco's technological roadmap. Finally, implications of
   symbiosis, platform, and co-evolution are provided for managers to
   challenge the contemporary business environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Keeping track of conceptual and methodological developments is a
   critical skill for research scientists, but this task is increasingly
   difficult due to the high rate of academic publication. As a crisis
   discipline, conservation science is particularly in need of tools that
   facilitate rapid yet insightful synthesis. We show how a common
   text-mining method (latent Dirichlet allocation, or topic modeling) and
   statistical tests familiar to ecologists (cluster analysis, regression,
   and network analysis) can be used to investigate trends and identify
   potential research gaps in the scientific literature. We tested these
   methods on the literature on ecological surrogates and indicators.
   Analysis of topic popularity within this corpus showed a strong emphasis
   on monitoring and management of fragmented ecosystems, while analysis of
   research gaps suggested a greater role for genetic surrogates and
   indicators. Our results show that automated text analysis methods need
   to be used with care, but can provide information that is complementary
   to that given by systematic reviews and meta-analyses, increasing
   scientists' capacity for research synthesis.},

Abstract = {With the development of Web 2.0, people would like to share opinions on
   the Web, which are very helpful for other users to make decisions.
   Especially, some users have more powerful influence to other members of
   a community, group, or society, and their advice, opinions, and views
   are more valuable. We call these people opinion leaders. The study of
   opinion leader discovery from the social media is meaningful because it
   could help users to understand influential user behavior, and trace
   vital information diffusion of an e-society, even on-line ecology.
   However, existing approaches focus on linkage-based methods without
   considering the pests who have relationship with the potential opinion
   leader but carrying opposite opinions. In an extreme case, an opinion
   leader might be mistakenly identified according to his richer
   relationships with the pests. In this paper, we start from explaining
   the definition of opinion leader, and take into consideration of the
   user profile and posts' opinions instead of using structural information
   (linkage) only. As such, those pests carrying opposite opinions could be
   gotten rid of from the social network, which could further improve the
   effectiveness of discovering opinion leaders. To evaluate the
   performance of our approach, we made experiments based on the Tweets
   data, and the results showed that our proposed approach could achieve
   8\% improvement compared with the linkage-based approach.},

Title = {Evidence of Experimental Bias in the Life Sciences: Why We Need Blind
   Data Recording},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Observer bias and other ``experimenter effects{''} occur when
   researchers' expectations influence study outcome. These biases are
   strongest when researchers expect a particular result, are measuring
   subjective variables, and have an incentive to produce data that confirm
   predictions. To minimize bias, it is good practice to work ``blind,{''}
   meaning that experimenters are unaware of the identity or treatment
   group of their subjects while conducting research. Here, using text
   mining and a literature review, we find evidence that blind protocols
   are uncommon in the life sciences and that nonblind studies tend to
   report higher effect sizes and more significant p-values. We discuss
   methods to minimize bias and urge researchers, editors, and peer
   reviewers to keep blind protocols in mind.},

Abstract = {American martens (Mantes americana) in the northern Lower Peninsula of
   Michigan (NLP) represent a re-introduced and isolated population that is
   the southern-most distributed marten population in eastern North
   America. During 2005-2006 we conducted a radiotelemetry and track-survey
   study of martens in the NLP. We estimated home-range size and patterns
   of habitat use in order to develop a spatial model to predict
   distribution of marten habitat. Marten home ranges were comprised of
   more (>75\%) upland deciduous and upland mixed forest compared to the
   landscape, which included <= 60\% of these cover types. Within core
   areas, martens selected upland conifer stands. Our Penrose habitat model
   identified <25\% of the NLP as primary marten habitat. Further, 70\% of
   marten habitat patches were <1000 ha in size and were isolated by an
   average of 5.3 km (SE= 2.0). Our marten habitat model identifies focal
   areas for surveying and monitoring populations and sites for
   supplementation or re-introduction. Our model also highlights the need
   for managers to better coordinate active landscape-scale management of
   wildlife and forests to reduce fragmentation impacts on extant and
   reintroduced marten populations.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The study of how the observable features of organisms, i.e., their
   phenotypes, result from the complex interplay between genetics,
   development, and the environment, is central to much research in
   biology. The varied language used in the description of phenotypes,
   however, impedes the large scale and interdisciplinary analysis of
   phenotypes by computational methods. The Phenoscape project
   (www.phenoscape.org) has developed semantic annotation tools and a
   gene-phenotype knowledgebase, the Phenoscape KB, that uses machine
   reasoning to connect evolutionary phenotypes from the comparative
   literature to mutant phenotypes from model organisms. The semantically
   annotated data enables the linking of novel species phenotypes with
   candidate genes that may underlie them. Semantic annotation of
   evolutionary phenotypes further enables previously difficult or novel
   analyses of comparative anatomy and evolution. These include generating
   large, synthetic character matrices of presence/absence phenotypes based
   on inference, and searching for taxa and genes with similar variation
   profiles using semantic similarity. Phenoscape is further extending
   these tools to enable users to automatically generate synthetic
   supermatrices for diverse character types, and use the domain knowledge
   encoded in ontologies for evolutionary trait analysis. Curating the
   annotated phenotypes necessary for this research requires significant
   human curator effort, although semi-automated natural language
   processing tools promise to expedite the curation of free text. As
   semantic tools and methods are developed for the biodiversity sciences,
   new insights from the increasingly connected stores of interoperable
   phenotypic and genetic data are anticipated.},

Abstract = {Have you ever found it difficult to read something because you lack
   knowledge on the topic? We investigated this phenomenon with a sample of
   3,534 high school students who took a background-knowledge test before

   Broken-line regression revealed a knowledge threshold: Below the
   threshold, the relationship between comprehension and knowledge was weak
   (beta = 0.18), but above the threshold, a strong and positive relation
   emerged (beta = 0.81). Further analyses indicated that certain topically
   relevant words (e.g., ecosystem, habitat) were more important to know
   than others when predicting the threshold, and these keywords could be
   identified using natural-language-processing techniques. Collectively,
   these results may help identify who is likely to have a problem
   comprehending information on a specific topic and, to some extent, what

Title = {Evaluating the popularity of R in ecology},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The programming language R is widely used in many fields. We explored
   the extent of reported R use in the field of ecology using the Web of
   Science and text mining. We analyzed the frequencies of R packages
   reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30
   ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of
   studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis
   increased linearly from 11.4\% in 2008 to 58.0\% in 2017. The top 10
   packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4,
   multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely
   furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve
   reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and
   codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique
   to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists,
   but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of
   reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary
   analytics in the field of ecology.},

Title = {Recognition of Latin scientific names using artificial neural networks},
Journal = {APPLICATIONS IN PLANT SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {PREMISE: The automated recognition of Latin scientific names within
   vernacular text has many applications, including text mining, search
   indexing, and automated specimen-label processing. Most published
   solutions are computationally inefficient, incapable of running within a
   web browser, and focus on texts in English, thus omitting a substantial
   portion of biodiversity literature.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: An open-source browser-executable solution,
   Quaesitor, is presented here. It uses pattern matching (regular
   expressions) in combination with an ensembled classifier composed of an
   inclusion dictionary search (Bloom filter), a trio of complementary
   neural networks that differ in their approach to encoding text, and word
   length to automatically identify Latin scientific names in the 16 most
   common languages for biodiversity articles.
   CONCLUSIONS: In combination, the classifiers can recognize Latin
   scientific names in isolation or embedded within the languages used for
   >96\% of biodiversity literature titles. For three different data sets,
   they resulted in a 0.80-0.97 recall and a 0.69-0.84 precision at a rate
   of 8.6 ms/word.},

Volume = {45},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {By combining digital humanities text-mining tools and a qualitative
   approach, we examine changing concepts in forestry journals in Sweden
   and the United States (US) in the early twentieth and early twenty-first
   centuries. Our first hypothesis is that foresters at the beginning of
   the twentieth century were more concerned with production and less
   concerned with ecology than foresters at the beginning of the
   twenty-first century. Our second hypothesis is that US foresters in the
   early twentieth century were less concerned with local site conditions
   than Swedish foresters. We find that early foresters in both countries
   had broader-and often ecologically focused-concerns than hypothesized.
   Ecological concerns in the forestry literature have increased, but in
   the Nordic countries, production concerns have increased as well. In
   both regions and both time periods, timber management is closely
   connected to concerns about governance and state power, but the forms
   that governance takes have changed.},

Title = {Mobilizing the community of biodiversity specimen collectors to

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {106},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1052-1058},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Premise Biological outliers (observations that fall outside of a
   previously understood norm, e.g., in phenology or distribution) may
   indicate early stages of a transformative change that merits immediate
   attention. Collectors of biodiversity specimens such as plants, fungi,
   and animals are on the front lines of discovering outliers, yet the role
   collectors currently play in providing such data is unclear. Methods We
   surveyed 222 collectors of a broad range of taxa, searched 47 training
   materials, and explored the use of 170 outlier terms in 75 million
   specimen records to determine the current state of outlier detection and
   documentation in this community. Results Collectors reported observing
   outliers (e.g., about 80\% of respondents observed morphological and
   distributional outliers at least occasionally). However, relatively few
   specimen records include outlier terms, and imprecision in their use and
   handling in data records complicates data discovery by stakeholders.
   This current state appears to be at least partly due to the absence of
   protocols: only one of the training materials addressed documenting and
   reporting outliers. Conclusions We suggest next steps to mobilize this
   largely untapped, yet ideally suited, community for early detection of
   biotic change in the Anthropocene, including community activities for
   building relevant best practices.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Rivers that cease to flow are globally prevalent. Although many epithets
   have been used for these rivers, a consensus on terminology has not yet
   been reached. Doing so would facilitate a marked increase in
   interdisciplinary interest as well as critical need for clear
   regulations. Here we reviewed literature from Web of Science database
   searches of 12 epithets to learn (Objective 1-O1) if epithet topics are
   consistent across Web of Science categories using latent Dirichlet
   allocation topic modeling. We also analyzed publication rates and topics
   over time to (O2) assess changes in epithet use. We compiled literature
   definitions to (O3) identify how epithets have been delineated and,
   lastly, suggest universal terms and definitions. We found a lack of
   consensus in epithet use between and among various fields. We also found
   that epithet usage has changed over time, as research focus has shifted
   from description to modeling. We conclude that multiple epithets are
   redundant. We offer specific definitions for three epithets
   (non-perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral) to guide consensus on
   epithet use. Limiting the number of epithets used in non-perennial river
   research can facilitate more effective communication among research
   fields and provide clear guidelines for writing regulatory documents.},

Abstract = {Microbial data and metadata are scattered throughout the scientific
   literature, databases and unpublished lab notes and thereby often are
   difficult to access. Hot spots of ( meta) data are internal descriptions
   of culture collections and initial descriptions of novel taxa in primary
   literature. Here we describe three exemplary mobilization projects which
   yielded metadata published through the prokaryotic metadatabase BacDive.
   The Reichenbach collection of myxobacteria includes information on
   12,535 typewritten index cards which were digitized. A total of 37,156
   data points were extracted by text mining. In the second mobilization
   project, Analytical Profile Index (API) tests on paper forms were
   targeted. Overall 6820 API tests were digitized, which provide
   physiological data of 4524 microbial strains. Thirdly, the extraction of
   metadata from 523 new species descriptions of the International Journal
   of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, yielding 35,651 data

Title = {EXTRACT: interactive extraction of environment metadata and term
   suggestion for metagenomic sample annotation},
Journal = {DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION},
Year = {2016},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {The microbial and molecular ecology research communities have made
   substantial progress on developing standards for annotating samples with
   environment metadata. However, sample manual annotation is a highly
   labor intensive process and requires familiarity with the terminologies
   used. We have therefore developed an interactive annotation tool,
   EXTRACT, which helps curators identify and extract standard-compliant
   terms for annotation of metagenomic records and other samples. Behind
   its web-based user interface, the system combines published methods for
   named entity recognition of environment, organism, tissue and disease
   terms. The evaluators in the BioCreative V Interactive Annotation Task
   found the system to be intuitive, useful, well documented and
   sufficiently accurate to be helpful in spotting relevant text passages
   and extracting organism and environment terms. Comparison of fully
   manual and text-mining-assisted curation revealed that EXTRACT speeds up
   annotation by 15-25\% and helps curators to detect terms that would
   otherwise have been missed.},

   used interchangeably, jointly and overlapping with innovation ecosystems
   (IE) and digital ecosystems (DE), making it difficult to differentiate,

   and industry. We use text mining techniques to reveal overlapping and
   exclusive terminologies used in academic articles on the three types of
   ecosystems. Processing of keywords has identified the current
   positioning of related domains in a tripartite framework. Keywords
   Network Analysis has revealed domains that share knowledge with the
   larger domains of Smart City, Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) and Helix
   interaction concepts, thereby providing insights into knowledge sharing
   across boundaries of BE, IE and DE. The results offer a basis for
   classification and baseline of current state of knowledge distribution
   across the ecosystems that can aid in ecosystems design, collaborations
   planning, interdisciplinary research and policy making.},

Abstract = {Extracting valuable information in terms of number and content of
   published papers in any field of research will simplify decision making
   for future researches and investments. A novel and simple text mining
   approach, called TrendFinder, has been developed in this paper to reveal
   the content-based trends of expert-defined queries in selected
   biological published papers during the last five decades. So, in order
   to evaluate the results, three different data sets were collected and
   four vectors of selected keywords were considered as the four queries.
   Title, Published date and the Abstract were downloaded for three series
   of journals namely, ``Conservation Biology{''}, ``Ecology{''}, and ``The
   American Naturalist{''} as data sets, including total number of 19,010
   papers. In order to show the trend between each query and the Abstract
   of each paper, Cosine similarity method was used by TrendFinder.
   Afterwards, three diagrams were demonstrated content-based trends of the
   four defined queries on the three provided data sets.},

Abstract = {Microbiome studies focused on the genetic potential of microbial
   communities (metagenomics) became standard within microbial ecology.
   MG-RAST and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the two main metagenome
   repositories, contain over 202 858 public available metagenomes and this
   number has increased exponentially. However, mining databases can be
   challenging due to misannotated, misleading and decentralized data. The
   main goal of TerrestrialMetagenomeDB is to make it easier for scientists
   to find terrestrial metagenomes of interest that could be compared with
   novel datasets in meta-analyses. We defined terrestrial metagenomes as
   those that do not belong to marine environments. Further, we curated the
   database using text mining to assign potential descriptive keywords that
   better contextualize environmental aspects of terrestrial metagenomes,
   such as biomes and materials. TerrestrialMetagenomeDB release 1.0
   includes 15 022 terrestrial metagenomes from SRA and MG-RAST. Together,
   the downloadable data amounts to 68 Tbp. In total, 199 terrestrial terms
   were divided into 14 categories. These metagenomes span 83 countries, 30
   biomes and 7 main source materials.},

Journal = {GUT PATHOGENS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {The commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microbial community which
   resides inside our body and on our skin (the human microbiome) can
   perturb host energy metabolism and immunity, and thus significantly
   influence development of a variety of human diseases. Therefore, the
   field has attracted unprecedented attention in the last decade. Although
   a large amount of data has been generated, there are still many
   unanswered questions and no universal agreements on how microbiome
   affects human health have been agreed upon. Consequently, this review
   was written to provide an updated overview of the rapidly expanding
   field, with a focus on revealing knowledge gaps and research
   opportunities. Specifically, the review covered animal physiology,
   optimal microbiome standard, health intervention by manipulating
   microbiome, knowledge base building by text mining, microbiota community
   structure and its implications in human diseases and health monitoring
   by analyzing microbiome in the blood. The review should enhance interest
   in conducting novel microbiota investigations that will further improve
   health and therapy.},

Title = {Next-generation phenomics for the Tree of Life},
Journal = {PLOS CURRENTS-TREE OF LIFE},
Year = {2013},
Abstract = {The phenotype represents a critical interface between the genome and the
   environment in which organisms live and evolve. Phenotypic characters
   also are a rich source of biodiversity data for tree building, and they
   enable scientists to reconstruct the evolutionary history of organisms,
   including most fossil taxa, for which genetic data are unavailable.
   Therefore, phenotypic data are necessary for building a comprehensive
   Tree of Life. In contrast to recent advances in molecular sequencing,
   which has become faster and cheaper through recent technological
   advances, phenotypic data collection remains often prohibitively slow
   and expensive. The next-generation phenomics project is a collaborative,
   multidisciplinary effort to leverage advances in image analysis,
   crowdsourcing, and natural language processing to develop and implement
   novel approaches for discovering and scoring the phenome, the collection
   of phentotypic characters for a species. This research represents a new
   approach to data collection that has the potential to transform
   phylogenetics research and to enable rapid advances in constructing the
   Tree of Life. Our goal is to assemble large phenomic datasets built
   using new methods and to provide the public and scientific community
   with tools for phenomic data assembly that will enable rapid and
   automated study of phenotypes across the Tree of Life.},

Abstract = {Using the public survey ``The Top 100 Japanese Rural Landscapes{''}
   conducted by Asahi Shimbun Newspaper Company in 2008, this study
   attempted to analyze public perception of rural landscapes and their
   cultural value. A total of 3,024 nominated sites were given coordinates
   and combined with land use and topographic datasets using a GIS, and
   classified into several landscape types using cluster analysis. Keywords
   that appeared frequently in the nominations were extracted using a
   text-mining tool and used to interpret the cultural value of each type.
   As a result, the nominated sites were divided into six types. The
   majority of nominated sites were classified as Forest Type (forest 88\%)
   and associated with the keywords traditional rural lifestyle, and sites
   to visit. Mixed Type (forest 50\%, paddy field 20\%, and other
   agricultural fields 10\%) were associated with biodiversity and
   conservation activities, and Paddy Field Type (paddy field 60\%) was
   significantly associated with Furusato (Home). Urban and Suburban Type
   sites (built-up land 50\%) were concentrated in the Kanto Region and
   nominated mainly by local citizens for their nature activities. There
   was also the Other Agricultural Type, which made up 10\% each of the
   nominations, and the Coastal Type, which was mostly nominated by
   ocean-related organizations and rarely nominated by the general public.
   Additionally, the concept of biodiversity seemed to be difficult for the
   public to understand. The results indicated that future studies should
   consider public perception of the variety of Satoyama landscapes and how
   it should be incorporated into future Satoyama management strategy.},

Abstract = {Habitat information is important to biodiversity conservation and
   research. Extracting bacterial biotope entities from scientific
   publications is important to large scale study of the relationships
   between bacteria and their living environments. To facilitate the
   further development of robust habitat text mining systems for
   biodiversity, following the BioNLP task framework, three sequence
   labeling techniques, CRFs (Conditional Random Fields), MEMM (Maximum
   Entropy Markov Model) and SVMhmm (Support Vector Machine) and one
   classifier, SVMmulticlass, are compared on their performance in
   identifying three types of bacterial biotope entities: bacteria,
   habitats and geographical locations. The effectiveness of a variety of
   basic word formation features, syntactic features, and semantic features
   are exploited and compared for the three sequence labeling methods.
   Experiments on two publicly available BioNLP collections show that, in
   addition to a Word Net feature, word embedding featured clusters
   (although not trained with the task-specific corpus) consistently
   improve the performance for all methods on all entity types in both
   collections. Other features produce various results. Our results also
   show that when trained on limited corpora. Brown clusters resulted in
   better performance than word embedding clusters did. Further analysis
   suggests that the entity recognition performance can be greatly boosted
   through improving the accuracy of entity boundary identification.},

Abstract = {In this paper we explore the combination of text-mining, un-supervised
   and supervised learning to extract predictive models from a corpus of
   digitised historical floras. These documents deal with the nomenclature,
   geographical distribution, ecology and comparative morphology of the
   species of a region. Here we exploit the fact that portions of text in
   the floras are marked up as different types of trait and habitat. We
   infer models from these different texts that can predict different
   habitat-types based upon the traits of plant species. We also integrate
   plant taxonomy data in order to assist in the validation of our models.
   We have shown that by clustering text describing the habitat of
   different floras we can identify a number of important and distinct
   habitats that are associated with particular families of species along
   with statistical significance scores. We have also shown that by using
   these discovered habitat-types as labels for supervised learning we can
   predict them based upon a subset of traits, identified using wrapper
   feature selection.},

Title = {Differences among Major Taxa in the Extent of Ecological Knowledge
   across Four Major Ecosystems},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Existing knowledge shapes our understanding of ecosystems and is
   critical for ecosystem-based management of the world's natural
   resources. Typically this knowledge is biased among taxa, with some taxa
   far better studied than others, but the extent of this bias is poorly
   known. In conjunction with the publically available World Registry of
   Marine Species database (WoRMS) and one of the world's premier
   electronic scientific literature databases (Web of Science (R)), a text
   mining approach is used to examine the distribution of existing
   ecological knowledge among taxa in coral reef, mangrove, seagrass and
   kelp bed ecosystems. We found that for each of these ecosystems, most
   research has been limited to a few groups of organisms. While this bias
   clearly reflects the perceived importance of some taxa as commercially
   or ecologically valuable, the relative lack of research of other
   taxonomic groups highlights the problem that some key taxa and
   associated ecosystem processes they affect may be poorly understood or
   completely ignored. The approach outlined here could be applied to any
   type of ecosystem for analyzing previous research effort and identifying
   knowledge gaps in order to improve ecosystem-based conservation and
   management.},

Abstract = {Plant morphology has been at the base of botanical systematics for
   centuries, resulting in a large body of descriptive plant data,
   including synoptic texts like monographs and floras and in recent times
   character matrices and trait databases. Systematic analysis of trait
   data is hampered by the lack of a standardized vocabulary and
   difficulties in extracting structured information from these knowledge
   sources. Therefore, the Flora Phenotype Ontology (FLOPO) was built by
   text mining floras for morphological entities and corresponding
   attributes (using PO and PATO), automated reasoning and subsequent
   manual curation. Consequently, FLOPO is comprised of a large number of
   morphological traits and phenotypes. By mobilizing such data from legacy
   literature, integration with data from other biodiversity data sources
   and images becomes possible: this includes (1) character matrices used
   for determination keys or morphology-based phylogenetics as well as (2)
   morphological traits extracted from other biodiversity literature such
   as taxonomic revisions and (3) traits extracted from images by pattern
   recognition. In this way, vast amounts of data are accessible for
   interlinkage with other domains, and for use in morphological,
   evolutionary, genetic, and ecological studies including species
   interactions and macroecology. FLOPO can be applied beyond biodiversity
   research in fields such as plant breeding, ethnobotany, horticulture,
   and through the frequent use of floral design, even in studies of arts
   and crafts. FLOPO can be browsed and downloaded from
   http://aber-owl.net/ontology/FLOPO. The FLOPO knowledgebase is
   accessible via http://flopo.senckenberg.de/sparql.},

Title = {Dialectones: Finding Statistically Significant Dialectal Boundaries
   Using Twitter Data},
Journal = {COMPUTACION Y SISTEMAS},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {1213-1222},
Abstract = {Most NLP applications assume that a particular language is homogeneous
   in the regions where it is spoken. However, each language varies
   considerably throughout its geographical distribution. To make NLP
   sensitive to dialects, a reliable, representative and up-to-date source
   of information that quantitatively represents such geographical
   variation is necessary. However, some of the current approaches have
   disadvantages such as the need for parameters, the disregard of the
   geographical coordinates in the analysis, and the use of linguistic
   alternations that presuppose the existence of specific dialectal
   varieties. Detection of ``ecotones{''} is an analogous problem in the
   field of ecology that focuses on the identification of boundaries,
   instead of regions, in ecosystems facilitating the construction of
   statistical tests. We adapted the concept of ``ecotone{''} to
   ``dialectone{''} for the detection of dialectal boundaries by using two
   non-parametric statistical tests: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence
   criterion (HSIC) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank. The proposed method was
   applied to a large corpus of Spanish tweets produced in 160 locations in
   Colombia through the analysis of unigram features. The resulting
   dialectones showed to be meaningful but difficult to compare against
   regions identified by other authors using classical dialectometry. We
   concluded that the automatic detection of dialectones is convenient
   alternative to classical methods in dialectometry and a potential source
   of information for automatic language applications.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Specimen identification keys are still the most commonly created tools
   used by systematic biologists to access biodiversity information.
   Creating identification keys requires analyzing and synthesizing large
   amounts of information from specimens and their descriptions and is a
   very labor-intensive and time-consuming activity. Automating the
   generation of identification keys from text descriptions becomes a
   highly attractive text mining application in the biodiversity domain.
   Fine-grained semantic annotation of morphological descriptions of
   organisms is a necessary first step in generating keys from text.
   Machine-readable ontologies are needed in this process because most
   biological characters are only implied (i.e., not stated) in
   descriptions. The immediate question to ask is ``How well do existing
   ontologies support semantic annotation and automated key
   generation?{''}With the intention to either select an existing ontology
   or develop a unified ontology based on existing ones, this paper
   evaluates the coverage, semantic consistency, and inter-ontology
   agreement of a biodiversity character ontology and three plant
   glossaries that may be turned into ontologies. The coverage and semantic
   consistency of the ontology/glossaries are checked against the
   authoritative domain literature, namely, Flora of North America and
   Flora of China. The evaluation results suggest that more work is needed
   to improve the coverage and interoperability of the ontology/glossaries.
   More concepts need to be added to the ontology/glossaries and careful
   work is needed to improve the semantic consistency. The method used in
   this paper to evaluate the ontology/glossaries can be used to propose
   new candidate concepts from the domain literature and suggest
   appropriate definitions.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a set of guidelines for the citation of zoological
   and botanical specimens in the European Journal of Taxonomy. The
   guidelines stipulate controlled vocabularies and precise formats for
   presenting the specimens examined within a taxonomic publication, which
   allow for the rich data associated with the primary research material to
   be harvested, distributed and interlinked online via international
   biodiversity data aggregators. Herein we explain how the EJT editorial
   standard was defined and how this initiative fits into the journal's
   project to semantically enhance its publications using the Plazi TaxPub
   DTD extension. By establishing a standardised format for the citation of
   taxonomic specimens, the journal intends to widen the distribution of
   and improve accessibility to the data it publishes. Authors who conform
   to these guidelines will benefit from higher visibility and new ways of
   visualising their work. In a wider context, we hope that other taxonomy
   journals will adopt this approach to their publications, adapting their
   working methods to enable domain-specific text mining to take place. If
   specimen data can be efficiently cited, harvested and linked to wider
   resources, we propose that there is also the potential to develop
   alternative metrics for assessing impact and productivity within the
   natural sciences.},

Title = {A novel E-commerce model and system based on O2O sports community},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {557-577},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {With the development of online communications and mobile community,
   various relationships among people which can be utilized by E-commerce
   are established. However, traditional E-commerce models are not
   integrated with communities and user relationships in the universal
   mobile community are not compact. In this paper, an O2O (online to
   offline) sports community, in which exercisers are divided into several
   online virtual organizations based on their residential area and
   interested sports, is designed. The community introduces a cloud storage
   based activity management framework and an activity ecology which is
   composed of five types of sports activities: home-made events, public
   services, live events watching, skill training and daily exercises.
   Next, a novel E-commerce model, which can establish various compact
   relationships among exercisers, activities and commodities through
   online communications and offline activities and with the help of
   natural language processing, sentiment analysis and social network
   technologies, is proposed on the basis of O2O sports community.
   Exerciser, commodity and activity models with some relevant attributes
   are carefully designed. Then, design issues of the corresponding
   E-commerce system are discussed, including several distinguished
   features and personal recommendations during the whole procedures of
   activities and daily discussions/communications among exercisers.
   Finally, preliminary results show that proposed model is well accepted
   by the exercisers and can achieve satisfied expected effect. We argue
   that both the novel E-commerce model and the O2O sports community can be
   applied in other areas.},

Title = {Perceptions of governments towards mitigating the environmental impacts
   of expressway construction projects: A case of China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {236},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The enormous impacts of expressway construction projects (ECPs) on the
   natural environment worldwide have created the urgency of involving both
   governments and contractors in the construction process. Governments
   play a substantial role in motivating contractors to adopt effective
   technologies and management paradigms to mitigate the environmental
   impacts of ECPs. A proper perception of this public matter and relevant
   management approaches is a prerequisite for governments to fulfill such
   a role. Using China as a case, the purpose of this study is to examine
   the scope of the environmental impacts that governments perceive and the
   evolution of the perceptions into management approaches. Response of
   provincial governments to environmental impact assessment for 132 ECPs
   was compiled as the materials of the study. Data were retrieved from the
   materials by using the text mining method. The data analysis reveals
   that: (1) governments follow the pressure-state-response framework to
   express their concerns over the environmental impacts; (2) the
   management approaches that governments consider are embedded in the
   impacts; (3) governments management approaches are intended to emphasize
   an ecological perspective. The research findings contribute as a
   cornerstone for researchers to examine the performance of governments on
   this public affair and shed some lights on same practices in other
   countries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Information retrieval in physical geography: A method to recover
   geographical information from digitized historical documents},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {369-390},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Information retrieval (IR) methods seek to locate meaningful documents
   in large collections of textual and other data. Few studies apply these
   techniques to discover descriptions in historical documents for physical
   geography applications. This absence is noteworthy given the use of
   qualitative historical descriptions in physical geography and the amount
   of historical documentation online. This study, therefore, introduces an
   IR approach for finding meaningful and geographically resolved
   historical descriptions in large digital collections of historical
   documents. Presenting a biogeography application, it develops a `search
   engine' using a boosted regression trees (BRT) model to assist in
   finding forest compositional descriptions (FCDs) based on textual
   features in a collection of county histories. The study then
   investigates whether FCDs corroborate existing estimates of relative
   abundances and spatial distributions of tree taxa from presettlement
   land survey records (PLSRs) and existing range maps. The BRT model is
   trained using portions of text from 458 US county histories. Evaluating
   the model's performance upon a spatially independent test dataset, the
   model helps discover 97.5\% of FCDs while reducing the amount of text to
   search through to 0.3\% of total. The prevalence rank of taxa in FCDs
   (i.e. the number of times a taxon is mentioned at least once in an FCD,
   divided by the total number of FCDs, then ranked) is strongly related to
   the abundance rank in PLSRs. Patterns in species mentions from FCDs
   generally match relative abundance patterns from PLSRs. However,
   analyses suggest that FCDs contain biases towards large and economically
   valuable tree taxa and against smaller taxa. In the end, the study
   demonstrates the potential of IR approaches for developing novel
   datasets over large geographic areas, corroborating existing historical
   datasets, and providing spatial coverage of historic phenomena.},

Title = {Uncertainty analysis of crowd-sourced and professionally collected field
   data used in species distribution models of Taiwanese moths},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {102-110},

Abstract = {The purposes of this study are to extract the names of species and
   places for a citizen-science monitoring program, to obtain crowd-sourced
   data of acceptable quality, and to assess the quality and the
   uncertainty of predictions based on crowd-sourced data and professional
   data. We used Natural Language Processing to extract names of species
   and places from text messages in a citizen science project. Bootstrap
   and Maximum Entropy methods were used to assess the uncertainty in the
   model predictions based on crowd-sourced data from the EnjoyMoths
   project in Taiwan. We compared uncertainty in the predictions obtained
   from the project and from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
   (GBIF) field data for seven focal species of moth. The proximity to
   locations of easy access and the Ripley K method were used to test the
   level of spatial bias and randomness of the crowd-sourced data against
   GBIF data. Our results show that extracting information to identify the
   names of species and their locations from crowd-sourced data performed
   well. The results of the spatial bias and randomness tests revealed that
   the crowd-sourced data and GBIF data did not differ significantly in
   respect to both spatial bias and clustering. The prediction models
   developed using the crowd-sourced dataset were the most effective,
   followed by those that were developed using the combined dataset. Those
   that performed least well were based on the small sample size GBIF
   dataset. Our method demonstrates the potential for using data collected
   by citizen scientists and the extraction of information from vast social
   networks. Our analysis also shows the value of citizen science data to
   improve biodiversity information in combination with data collected by
   professionals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The difficulties of systematic reviews},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1002-1007},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The need for robust evidence to support conservation actions has driven
   the adoption of systematic approaches to research synthesis in ecology.
   However, applying systematic review to complex or open questions remains
   challenging, and this task is becoming more difficult as the quantity of
   scientific literature increases. We drew on the science of linguistics
   for guidance as to why the process of identifying and sorting
   information during systematic review remains so labor intensive, and to
   provide potential solutions. Several linguistic properties of
   peer-reviewed corporaincluding nonrandom selection of review topics,
   small-world properties of semantic networks, and spatiotemporal
   variation in word meaninggreatly increase the effort needed to complete
   the systematic review process. Conversely, the resolution of these
   semantic complexities is a common motivation for narrative reviews, but
   this process is rarely enacted with the rigor applied during linguistic
   analysis. Therefore, linguistics provides a unifying framework for
   understanding some key challenges of systematic review and highlights 2
   useful directions for future research. First, in cases where semantic
   complexity generates barriers to synthesis, ecologists should consider
   drawing on existing methodssuch as natural language processing or the
   construction of research thesauri and ontologiesthat provide tools for
   mapping and resolving that complexity. These tools could help individual
   researchers classify research material in a more robust manner and
   provide valuable guidance for future researchers on that topic. Second,
   a linguistic perspective highlights that scientific writing is a rich
   resource worthy of detailed study, an observation that can sometimes be
   lost during the search for data during systematic review or
   meta-analysis. For example, mapping semantic networks can reveal
   redundancy and complementarity among scientific concepts, leading to new
   insights and research questions. Consequently, wider adoption of
   linguistic approaches may facilitate improved rigor and richness in
   research synthesis.},

Abstract = {Background: The task of recognizing and identifying species names in
   biomedical literature has recently been regarded as critical for a
   number of applications in text and data mining, including gene name
   recognition, species-specific document retrieval, and semantic
   enrichment of biomedical articles.
   Results: In this paper we describe an open-source species name
   recognition and normalization software system, LINNAEUS, and evaluate
   its performance relative to several automatically generated biomedical
   corpora, as well as a novel corpus of full-text documents manually
   annotated for species mentions. LINNAEUS uses a dictionary-based
   approach (implemented as an efficient deterministic finite-state
   automaton) to identify species names and a set of heuristics to resolve
   ambiguous mentions. When compared against our manually annotated corpus,
   LINNAEUS performs with 94\% recall and 97\% precision at the mention
   level, and 98\% recall and 90\% precision at the document level. Our
   system successfully solves the problem of disambiguating uncertain
   species mentions, with 97\% of all mentions in PubMed Central full-text
   documents resolved to unambiguous NCBI taxonomy identifiers.
   Conclusions: LINNAEUS is an open source, stand-alone software system
   capable of recognizing and normalizing species name mentions with speed
   and accuracy, and can therefore be integrated into a range of
   bioinformatics and text-mining applications. The software and manually
   annotated corpus can be downloaded freely at
   http://linnaeus.sourceforge.net/.},

Abstract = {With the advent of next generation genome sequencing, the number of
   sequenced algal genomes and transcriptomes is rapidly growing. Although
   a few genome portals exist to browse individual genome sequences,
   exploring complete genome information from multiple species for the
   analysis of user-defined sequences or gene lists remains a major
   challenge. pico-PLAZA is a web-based resource
   (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/pico-plaza/) for algal genomics that
   combines different data types with intuitive tools to explore genomic
   diversity, perform integrative evolutionary sequence analysis and study
   gene functions. Apart from homologous gene families, multiple sequence
   alignments, phylogenetic trees, Gene Ontology, InterPro and text-mining
   functional annotations, different interactive viewers are available to
   study genome organization using gene collinearity and synteny
   information. Different search functions, documentation pages, export
   functions and an extensive glossary are available to guide non-expert
   scientists. PLAZA can be used to functionally characterize large-scale
   ES /RNA-Seq data sets and to perform environmental genomics. Functional
   enrichments analysis of 16 Phaeodactylumtricornutum transcriptome
   libraries offers a molecular view on diatom adaptation to different
   environments of ecological relevance. Furthermore, we show how
   complementary genomic data sources can easily be combined to identify
   marker genes to study the diversity and distribution of algal species,
   for example in metagenomes, or to quantify intraspecific diversity from
   environmental strains.},

Title = {NetiNeti: discovery of scientific names from text using machine learning
   methods},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Background: A scientific name for an organism can be associated with
   almost all biological data. Name identification is an important step in
   many text mining tasks aiming to extract useful information from
   biological, biomedical and biodiversity text sources. A scientific name
   acts as an important metadata element to link biological information.
   Results: We present NetiNeti (Name Extraction from Textual
   Information-Name Extraction for Taxonomic Indexing), a machine learning
   based approach for recognition of scientific names including the
   discovery of new species names from text that will also handle
   misspellings, OCR errors and other variations in names. The system
   generates candidate names using rules for scientific names and applies
   probabilistic machine learning methods to classify names based on
   structural features of candidate names and features derived from their
   contexts. NetiNeti can also disambiguate scientific names from other
   names using the contextual information. We evaluated NetiNeti on legacy
   biodiversity texts and biomedical literature (MEDLINE). NetiNeti
   performs better (precision = 98.9\% and recall = 70.5\%) compared to a
   popular dictionary based approach (precision = 97.5\% and recall =
   54.3\%) on a 600-page biodiversity book that was manually marked by an
   annotator. On a small set of PubMed Central's full text articles
   annotated with scientific names, the precision and recall values are
   98.5\% and 96.2\% respectively. NetiNeti found more than 190,000 unique
   binomial and trinomial names in more than 1,880,000 PubMed records when
   used on the full MEDLINE database. NetiNeti also successfully identifies
   almost all of the new species names mentioned within web pages.
   Conclusions: We present NetiNeti, a machine learning based approach for
   identification and discovery of scientific names. The system
   implementing the approach can be accessed at

Abstract = {In order to deal with the problem of semantic and schematic
   heterogeneity in collaborative networks, matching components among
   database schemas need to be identified and heterogeneity needs to be
   resolved, by creating the corresponding mappings in a process called
   schema matching. One important step in this process is the
   identification of the syntactic and semantic similarity among elements
   from different schemas, usually referred to as Linguistic Matching. The
   Linguistic Matching component of a schema matching and integration
   system, called SASMINT, is the focus of this paper. Unlike other
   systems, which typically utilize only a limited number of similarity
   metrics, SASMINT makes an effective use of NLP techniques for the
   Linguistic Matching and proposes a weighted usage of several syntactic
   and semantic similarity metrics. Since it is not easy for the user to
   determine the weights, SASMINT provides a component called Sampler as
   another novelty, to support automatic generation of weights.},

Abstract = {Green behavior is an important part of the study of green development.
   To promote green development, it is necessary to engage in further
   innovation on the basis of lessons from international advancements in
   green behavior. To clarify the spatial and temporal distribution
   characteristics of international researchers in the study of green
   behavior, the research focus, and the research frontiers, a visual
   analysis was performed on 22,114 articles cited in the SSCI and
   SCI-EXPANDED databases from 2000 to 2017. This analysis was based on
   bibliometrics and mapping knowledge domain (MKD) analysis with CiteSpace
   5.3.R4, a scientific and technological text-mining and visualization
   software. The results show that international green behavior research
   has the following main characteristics. First, a positive correlation
   was found between the number of papers and time. Second, research is
   highly valued by researchers in the natural sciences, such as ecology.
   The USA is involved in major research efforts and maintains a high level
   of cooperation with other countries and regions. International
   cooperation among institutions needs to be strengthened. The co-cited
   journals are primarily academic journals in the natural sciences. Third,
   research hotspots mainly focus on the theory of planned behavior (TPB),
   consumers, attitudes, performance, and environment, all of which evolve
   according to the phase path of germination-growth. Fourth, the research
   frontier issues are largely related to management science and
   environmental science, and the research objects and methods will become
   increasingly complex and interdisciplinary over time.},

Title = {Towards a general theory of similarity and association measures:
   Similarity, dissimilarity and correlation functions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT \& FUZZY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {2977-3004},
Abstract = {Similarity, correlation and association measures play an important role
   in statistics, information retrieval, data mining and data science,
   classification and machine learning, recommender systems and
   decision-making. They have numerous applications in ecology, social and
   behavioral sciences, biology and bioinformatics, social network and time
   series analysis, image and natural language processing. Often the
   measures with the same name introduced on different domains have
   different properties, and the measures with the same properties have
   different names. To unify analysis of measures defined on different
   domains, this paper considers these measures as functions defined on
   universal domain and satisfying some sets of properties. The general
   properties of similarity functions (SF) and dissimilarity functions (DF)
   under the joint name of resemblance functions (RF) studied on universal
   domain and illustrated by examples on specific domains. The known and
   the new methods of construction of similarity measures are considered.
   This paper discusses the following aspects of RF: relationship with
   fuzzy (valued) relations, T-transitivity and triangle inequality,
   Minkowski distance and data transformation, cosine SF, RF on domains
   with involution (negation), aggregation and transformations of RF,
   visualization of RF. The paper considers also the lattice of RF,
   composition and min-transitive transformations of SF (fuzzy proximity
   relations), applications to hierarchical clustering and
   non-probabilistic entropy of RF. In addition, the paper proposes the
   method of construction of correlation functions (association measures)
   using SF. Pearson correlation and Yule's Q association coefficients
   obtained as particular cases of the general method. One can use the
   paper as a survey of works on similarity and dissimilarity measures on
   specific domains, as a guide for constructing new similarity and
   correlation measures, as a base for the study of mathematical properties
   of resemblance functions on universal and specific domains, and also as
   a part of the course on Data Science.},

Title = {The Use of Recreational Fishers' Ecological Knowledge to Assess the
   Conservation Status of Marine Ecosystems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {There is a reluctance to incorporate Fishers' Ecological Knowledge (FEK)
   into the evidence base used to underpin marine management decisions. FEK
   has proved to be useful as an alternative reference of biological
   changes in data-poor scenarios. Yet, recreational fisher knowledge has
   rarely been included in scientific studies despite being a source of
   FEK. Here, the use of recreational FEK to assess the conservation status
   of marine ecosystems in Galicia (NW Spain) was evaluated. Galicia has a
   highly complex marine socioecological system that includes both a large
   global commercial fleet and a powerful recreational sector, alongside
   other important stakeholders (e.g., tourism, aquaculture). Anglers and
   spear fishers were asked to provide their perceptions of the
   conservation status of fish stocks and the impacts on marine ecosystems.
   Face-toface interviews were transcribed into text and analyzed using
   text mining tools. Key concepts were used to quantify fishers'
   perceptions of changes in their target fish stocks and quantify the main
   impacts on marine ecosystems. Overfishing and habitat loss, followed by
   reduction in biodiversity, pollution, and warming temperatures were
   considered to be the main drivers of the poor status of cephalopods and
   finfish stocks. Perceived temporal declines in fish stocks were
   consistent with available biological data, highlighting the potential
   for recreational FEK to be used to assess long-term ecological changes.
   It was important to seek opinions from different users, including
   fishers from traditional commercial and recreational fisheries, as these
   groups had good knowledge of the impacts on natural and cultural
   community heritage. The poor status of ballann wrasse (Labrus bergylta)
   and kelp beds was identified, which was of concern due to it being a key
   species in coastal ecosystems. Use of FEK is a good approach to develop
   knowledge of these systems, but broader monitoring programs are needed
   to protect the future of these ecosystems.},

Title = {Conservation planners tend to ignore improved accuracy of modelled
   species distributions to focus on multiple threats and ecological
   processes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {199},
Pages = {157-171},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Limited conservation resources mean that management decisions are often
   made on the basis of scarce biological information. Species distribution
   models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed as a way to improve the
   representation of biodiversity features in conservation planning, but
   the extent to which SDMs are used in conservation planning is unclear.
   We reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey conservation planning literature
   to explore if and how SDMs are used in conservation prioritisations. We
   use text mining to analyse 641 peer-reviewed conservation prioritisation
   articles published between 2006 and 2012 and find that only 10\% of
   atticles specifically mention SDMs in the abstract, title, and/or
   keywords. We use topic modelling of all peer-reviewed articles plus a
   detailed review of a random sample of 40 peer-reviewed and grey
   literature plans to evaluate factors that might influence whether
   decision-makers use SDMs to inform prioritisations. Our results reveal
   that habitat maps, expert-elicited species distributions, or metrics
   representing landscape processes (e.g. connectivity surfaces) are used
   more often than SDMs as biodiversity surrogates in prioritisations. We
   find four main reasons for using such alternatives in place of SDMs: (i)
   insufficient species occurrence data (particularly for threatened
   species); (ii) lack of biologically-meaningful predictor data relevant
   to the spatial scale of planning; (iii) low concern about uncertainty in
   biodiversity data; and (iv) a focus on accounting for ecological,
   evolutionary, and cumulative threatening processes that requires
   alternative data to be collected. Our results suggest that SDMs are
   perceived as best-suited to dealing with traditional reserve selection
   objectives and accounting for uncertainties such as future climate
   change or mapping accuracy. The majority of planners in both the grey
   and peer-reviewed literature appear to trade off the benefits of using
   SDMs for the benefits of including information on multiple threats and
   processes. We suggest that increasing the complexity of species
   distribution modelling methods might have little impact on their use in
   conservation planning without a corresponding increase in research
   aiming at better incorporation of a range of ecological, evolutionary,
   and threatening processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Finding academic concerns of the Three Gorges Project based on a topic
   modeling approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {693-701},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Three Gorges Project (TGP) has gone into the overall completion
   acceptance stage in 2014. As the world's largest hydropower project, the
   TGP has attracted worldwide attention over the past few decades.
   Previous studies mainly focused on a single aspect, such as engineering
   technologies, social impacts and environmental impacts, of the TGP.
   However, a large-scale review gathering systematic data to find academic
   concerns about the TGP is missing. Topic model is a text mining approach
   for discovering latent topics in a collection of documents. In this
   article, an emerging topic modeling approach, Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation (LDA), was introduced to uncover the intellectual structure
   of the academic literature focusing on the TGP. A collection of 8280
   Chinese research articles highly related to the TGP was established with
   a time frame ranging from 2001 to 2013, and an 18-topic model was used
   to describe the intellectual structure. Two novel bibliometric
   indicators, including topic proportion and topic trend, were constructed
   to describe the academic concerns of the TGP. Topic proportion analysis
   shows that post-construction issues, including the social and
   environmental impacts brought by the TGP, have attracted more attention
   than the construction issues. ``Ecology{''}, ``Reservoir Operation{''},
   ``Land Administration{''}, and ``Water Pollution{''}, have become the
   dominant research topics regarding the TGP during these years.
   Meanwhile, ``Construction Technology{''} and ``Design{''}, have
   gradually lost scholars' interest. The results show that the approach
   reported in this study can provide sound and credible conclusions of the
   major academic concerns for a hydropower project. The topic modeling
   approach is expected to be widely applied as a methodological strategy
   in future hydropower and other infrastructure project assessment. (C)

Title = {Using legacy botanical literature as a source of phytogeographical data},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {148},
Number = {2},
Pages = {256-266},
Abstract = {Aim - Paper-based publications were the main repository for
   phytogeographical information until the end of the 20th century. These
   texts are still an important reference source for phytogeography and
   potentially a valuable source of data for research on environmental
   change. The recent digitization of biodiversity publications,
   text-mining and mark-up protocols means that these data are now more
   accessible than ever before. Here I examine the value of legacy
   literature specifically for studies on phytogeography.
   Methods - Three contrasting data mobilisation projects are used as case
   studies for the extraction of phytogeographic data. Two were
   digitisations and XML mark-up of floras, the Flore d'Afrique Centrale
   from the 20th century and the Flora of Northumberland and Durham from
   the 19th century. A third case study used Chenopodium vulvaria L. as a
   test case, where I attempted to recover as much phytogeographic data as
   possible for one species, both from literature and from herbarium
   specimens.
   Results - A large amount of useful information was extractable from
   legacy literature. The main limitations are that most localities need
   georeferencing and that observations are only rarely associated with a
   precise date. In the case of C. vulvaria literature contributed about
   20\% of all available observations of the species. Literature becomes a
   progressively more important source of data the further back in time one
   looks. However, useful observations become much rarer earlier than about
   1850.
   Main conclusions - Sourcing phytogeographic data from legacy literature
   is valuable. It contains observations and links to other data that are
   unavailable from any other source. Nevertheless, its extraction takes a
   substantial investment in time. Before commencing on such a project it
   is important to prioritise work and understand the limitations of such
   data, particularly with regard to georeferencing.},

Title = {Building the ``Plant Glossary{''}-A controlled botanical vocabulary
   using terms extracted from the Floras of North America and China},
Journal = {TAXON},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {953-966},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Taxonomic descriptions contain valuable phenotypic data that is often
   not directly accessible for modern evolutionary, ecological, or
   biodiversity analyses. We describe a process for building a
   consensus-based controlled vocabulary from taxonomic descriptions for
   plants, which also can be applied for building controlled vocabularies
   for other taxon groups. Controlled vocabularies are useful as lexicons
   for text mining algorithms, as source of candidate terms for ontologies,
   and as guides to help future authors use domain vocabulary more
   appropriately and consistently. We extracted phenotype-describing
   phrases terms from descriptions of 30 volumes of the Flora of North
   America and Flora of China and merged these with terms from the
   Categorical Glossary of the Flora of North America. Seven contributors
   placed the terms into a set of categories until there was an agreement
   among two or more categorizations per term. Term categorization makes
   the meaning of a term more explicit for the subsequent users of the
   glossary. The resulting ``Plant Glossary{''} (terms and categorization
   of terms) contains 9228 terms grouped in 53 categories. Differences in
   term categorization represented 49\% of the categorization effort, and
   the many differences among individual classifications can be attributed
   to individual interpretation of terms and to the fluid nature of
   descriptive language used in Floras. The difficulties experienced while
   classifying the terms allowed us to explore cases where the use of
   language can hinder the accurate and detailed annotation of taxonomic
   descriptions. The Plant Glossary represents a significant step towards
   creating and enriching formal ontologies for plant phenotypes as the
   semantic phenomena found through this exercise is useful background
   information for building ontologies. The glossary has been used by new
   software to parse and annotate plant taxonomic descriptions, and over
   6000 new terms are available for creating ontologies.},

Title = {Probabilistic topic modeling for the analysis and classification of
   genomic sequences},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {Background: Studies on genomic sequences for classification and
   taxonomic identification have a leading role in the biomedical field and
   in the analysis of biodiversity. These studies are focusing on the
   so-called barcode genes, representing a well defined region of the whole
   genome. Recently, alignment-free techniques are gaining more importance
   because they are able to overcome the drawbacks of sequence alignment
   techniques. In this paper a new alignment-free method for DNA sequences
   clustering and classification is proposed. The method is based on k-mers
   representation and text mining techniques.
   Methods: The presented method is based on Probabilistic Topic Modeling,
   a statistical technique originally proposed for text documents.
   Probabilistic topic models are able to find in a document corpus the
   topics (recurrent themes) characterizing classes of documents. This
   technique, applied on DNA sequences representing the documents, exploits
   the frequency of fixed-length k-mers and builds a generative model for a
   training group of sequences. This generative model, obtained through the
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, is then used to classify a
   large set of genomic sequences.
   Results and conclusions: We performed classification of over 7000 16S
   DNA barcode sequences taken from Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)
   repository, training probabilistic topic models. The proposed method is
   compared to the RDP tool and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification
   algorithm in a extensive set of trials using both complete sequences and
   short sequence snippets (from 400 bp to 25 bp). Our method reaches very
   similar results to RDP classifier and SVM for complete sequences. The
   most interesting results are obtained when short sequence snippets are
   considered. In these conditions the proposed method outperforms RDP and
   SVM with ultra short sequences and it exhibits a smooth decrease of
   performance, at every taxonomic level, when the sequence length is
   decreased.},

Title = {The geography of publishing in the Anthropocene},
Journal = {CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One key aspect of the Anthropocene is the inherent disparities between
   the Global North and the Global South. These differences manifest in the
   causes and impacts of pollution, climate change, and species
   extinctions, but are they also present in the ways we write about the
   Anthropocene? We examine 77 peer-reviewed papers spanning 2009-2019 that
   explicitly feature conservation in an Anthropocene context. We compare
   these papers to a control group of papers that feature conservation but
   do not engage specifically with the Anthropocene literature. We found
   that both ``Anthropocene{''} and ``conservation{''} papers include a
   disproportionately large number of authors with affiliations in the
   Global North, despite half of the research taking place in the Global
   South. Moreover, this overrepresentation occurs regardless of author
   position or journal impact factor. We find that 84\% of Anthropocene
   articles and 91\% of conservation articles occurring in the Global North
   had a first author from the country of study, as opposed to only 55\% of
   Anthropocene articles and 62\% of conservation articles from the Global
   South. Studies occurring in the Global North almost always had at least
   one coauthor from the country of study (96\% of Anthropocene articles
   and 97\% of conservation articles). In contrast, only 81\% of
   Anthropocene articles and 83\% of conservation articles occurring in the
   Global South had any local coauthors. We used two text-mining algorithms
   to characterize the authorship networks and topics occurring in
   Anthropocene and conservation papers. These analyses showed that while
   both groups are interdisciplinary, Anthropocene papers had more
   distributed authorship networks and greater linkages across topics, and
   therefore have a flatter ``topic surface{''} than the conservation
   papers. Our work suggests that conservation research programs that are
   explicitly grounded in the Anthropocene as a theoretical framework are
   more likely to reach across disciplinary lines.},

Title = {IMPLEMENTING ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS IN SEMI-REGULATED AND UNREGULATED
   RIVERS USING A FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK: CASE STUDIES FROM TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA},
Journal = {RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {30},
Number = {5},
Pages = {578-592},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite the many methodologies available for undertaking environmental
   flow assessments, there are few published examples of environmental flow
   recommendations that arise from those assessments, and even fewer that
   evaluate their implementation. This is somewhat surprising considering
   environmental flow recommendations are effectively testable hypotheses
   of flow-ecology responses. We describe a framework to guide the
   assessment and recommendation of environmental flow regimes in Tasmania,
   Australia, where environmental values are highly catchment specific and
   rivers are largely semi-regulated or unregulated. This means that
   environmental flows must be focussed on setting water use thresholds to
   prevent degradation in condition, rather than delivering water to
   restore condition. The framework retains the philosophy and elements of
   many other methodologies but differs by having the flexibility to
   support application across different catchments while catering for
   catchment-specific issues. We present two case studies that demonstrate
   the application of our Framework, its use in the development of
   scientifically defensible environmental flow recommendations, and their
   implementation in catchment water management plans. The strengths of the
   Framework are: (i) using specific ecosystem values to define and
   communicate the objectives of environmental flows; (ii) using a
   non-prescriptive and flexible approach to incorporate catchment-specific
   issues; and (iii) framing recommendations in a manner that clearly
   illustrates flow linkages with ecosystem values so that stakeholders and
   managers understand the risks associated with water abstraction. Our
   experience demonstrates the imperative that scientists are not only
   involved in water planning but also in the implementation, monitoring,
   and evaluation of plans so that the benefits of adaptive management can
   be realized. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {The environment ontology in 2016: bridging domains with increased scope,
   semantic density, and interoperation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Background: The Environment Ontology (ENVO;
   http://www.environmentontology.org/), first described in 2013, is a
   resource and research target for the semantically controlled description
   of environmental entities. The ontology's initial aim was the
   representation of the biomes, environmental features, and environmental
   materials pertinent to genomic and microbiome-related investigations.
   However, the need for environmental semantics is common to a multitude
   of fields, and ENVO's use has steadily grown since its initial
   description. We have thus expanded, enhanced, and generalised the
   ontology to support its increasingly diverse applications.
   Methods: We have updated our development suite to promote expressivity,
   consistency, and speed: we now develop ENVO in the Web Ontology Language
   (OWL) and employ templating methods to accelerate class creation. We
   have also taken steps to better align ENVO with the Open Biological and
   Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry principles and interoperate with
   existing OBO ontologies. Further, we applied text-mining approaches to
   extract habitat information from the Encyclopedia of Life and
   automatically create experimental habitat classes within ENVO.
   Results: Relative to its state in 2013, ENVO's content, scope, and
   implementation have been enhanced and much of its existing content
   revised for improved semantic representation. ENVO now offers
   representations of habitats, environmental processes, anthropogenic
   environments, and entities relevant to environmental health initiatives
   and the global Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030. Several branches
   of ENVO have been used to incubate and seed new ontologies in previously
   unrepresented domains such as food and agronomy. The current release
   version of the ontology, in OWL format, is available at
   http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo.owl.
   Conclusions: ENVO has been shaped into an ontology which bridges
   multiple domains including biomedicine, natural and anthropogenic
   ecology, `omics, and socioeconomic development. Through continued
   interactions with our users and partners, particularly those performing
   data archiving and sythesis, we anticipate that ENVO's growth will
   accelerate in 2017. As always, we invite further contributions and
   collaboration to advance the semantic representation of the environment,
   ranging from geographic features and environmental materials, across
   habitats and ecosystems, to everyday objects in household settings.},

Title = {Global hotspots and correlates of emerging zoonotic diseases},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Zoonoses originating from wildlife represent a significant threat to
   global health, security and economic growth, and combatting their
   emergence is a public health priority. However, our understanding of the
   mechanisms underlying their emergence remains rudimentary. Here we
   update a global database of emerging infectious disease (EID) events,
   create a novel measure of reporting effort, and fit boosted regression
   tree models to analyze the demographic, environmental and biological
   correlates of their occurrence. After accounting for reporting effort,
   we show that zoonotic EID risk is elevated in forested tropical regions
   experiencing land-use changes and where wildlife biodiversity (mammal
   species richness) is high. We present a new global hotspot map of
   spatial variation in our zoonotic EID risk index, and partial dependence
   plots illustrating relationships between events and predictors. Our
   results may help to improve surveillance and long-term EID monitoring
   programs, and design field experiments to test underlying mechanisms of
   zoonotic disease emergence.},

Title = {Methodology capture: discriminating between the ``best{''} and the rest
   of community practice},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Background: The methodologies we use both enable and help define our
   research. However, as experimental complexity has increased the choice
   of appropriate methodologies has become an increasingly difficult task.
   This makes it difficult to keep track of available bioinformatics
   software, let alone the most suitable protocols in a specific research
   area. To remedy this we present an approach for capturing methodology
   from literature in order to identify and, thus, define best practice
   within a field.
   Results: Our approach is to implement data extraction techniques on the
   full-text of scientific articles to obtain the set of experimental
   protocols used by an entire scientific discipline, molecular
   phylogenetics. Our methodology for identifying methodologies could in
   principle be applied to any scientific discipline, whether or not
   computer-based. We find a number of issues related to the nature of best
   practice, as opposed to community practice. We find that there is much
   heterogeneity in the use of molecular phylogenetic methods and software,
   some of which is related to poor specification of protocols. We also
   find that phylogenetic practice exhibits field-specific tendencies that
   have increased through time, despite the generic nature of the available
   software. We used the practice of highly published and widely
   collaborative researchers ({''}expert{''} researchers) to analyse the
   influence of authority on community practice. We find expert authors
   exhibit patterns of practice common to their field and therefore act as
   useful field-specific practice indicators.
   Conclusion: We have identified a structured community of phylogenetic
   researchers performing analyses that are customary in their own local
   community and significantly different from those in other areas. Best
   practice information can help to bridge such subtle differences by
   increasing communication of protocols to a wider audience. We propose
   that the practice of expert authors from the field of evolutionary
   biology is the closest to contemporary best practice in phylogenetic
   experimental design. Capturing best practice is, however, a complex task
   and should also acknowledge the differences between fields such as the
   specific context of the analysis.},

Title = {Biogeography and emerging significance of Actinobacteria in Australia
   and Northern Antarctica soils},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Actinobacteria play key roles in terrestrial ecosystem functioning. They
   contribute to global carbon cycling through the decomposition of soil
   organic matter, increase plant productivity and are widely known as
   prolific producers of bioactive compounds essential for human and animal
   health. The almost century-old search for new members of the
   Actinobacteria has so far proceeded without systematic investigation of
   regions where novel, diverse and abundant actinobacterial populations
   occur. We show that such regions are found in Australia, a dry and warm
   continent with highly weathered soils. Here, Actinobacteria are highly
   abundant and evidently well-adapted to the warm, dry soil conditions.
   Australian continental actinobacterial diversity is associated with
   physicochemical factors, especially soil pH(water), exchangeable calcium
   and the regional climate. Patterns of their biogeography suggest that
   only a small fraction of Actinobacteria have the capability of
   dispersing throughout the Southern Hemisphere, especially across oceans.
   We identified a core soil actinobacterial community across mainland
   Australia of 2211 OTUs which declined to 490 OTUs when Tasmania, King
   Island, Christmas Island and Northern Antarctica were included. These
   490 OTUs mapped to three families, i.e., Gaiellaceae, Micromonosporaceae
   and Nocardiaceae. Agricultural disturbance reduced actinobacterial
   diversity, hence undisturbed soils with native vegetation may be
   reservoirs that enrich the actinobacterial communities in adjacent
   agricultural soils. Interestingly, high OTU similarities between King
   Island and areas in Antarctica suggest a shared evolutionary history
   that persists to this day. In conclusion, the abundance of diverse
   Actinobacteria taxa in Australian soils suggests an increasingly
   important function of Actinobacteria as the world's soils become warmer
   and drier.},

Abstract = {A list of spider species is presented for the Belem Area of Endemism,
   the most threatened region in the Amazon Basin, comprising portions of

   are based both on records from the taxonomic and biodiversity survey
   literature and on scientific collection databases. A total of 319
   identified species were recorded, with 318 occurring in Para and only 22
   in Maranhao. About 80\% of species are recorded at the vicinities of the
   city of Belem, indicating that sampling effort have been strongly
   biased. To identify potentially high- diversity areas, discounting the
   effect of variations in sampling effort, the residues of a linear
   regression between the number of records and number of species mapped in
   each 0.25 degrees grid cells were analyzed. One grid, representing the
   Alto Turia double dagger u Indigenous land, had the highest deviation
   from the expected from the linear regression, indicating high expected
   species richness. Several other grid cells showed intermediate values of
   the regression residuals, indicating species richness moderately above

Title = {A spatial and temporal assessment of fire regimes on different
   vegetation types using MODIS burnt area products},
Journal = {BOTHALIA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2, SI},
Abstract = {Background: The role of fire in maintaining grassland diversity has been
   widely recognised; however, its effect in KwaZulu-Natal grasslands is
   still rudimentary. In that regard, understanding fire regimes of
   different vegetation types in KwaZulu-Natal is a critical step towards
   the development of effective management strategies that are specific to
   each vegetation type.
   Objective: To assess the effect of different vegetation types on fire
   regimes in KwaZulu-Natal using moderate resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt fire products.
   Method: Ten years of fire data for four different vegetation types
   (Ngongoni Veld, KwaZuluNatal Sandstone Sourveld, Eastern Valley Bushveld
   and KwaZulu-Natal Coastal Belt) were extracted from the MODIS products
   and used as a basis to establish three parameters: annual burnt areas,
   fire season and fire frequency. The total burnt area within each
   vegetation type over the 10-year period was quantified.
   Results: The KZN Sandstone Sourveld had a high-burnt area of 80\% in
   2009 with KwaZulu-Natal Coastal Belt having the least burnt area of less
   than 5\%. Ngongoni Veld and the KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld had the
   highest fire frequency, while the coastal region had low fire
   frequencies. Results showed high fire prevalence during the late period
   of the dry season (which extends from June to August) across all the
   vegetation types.
   Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of remotely sensed data
   (MODIS burned area products) in providing a comprehensive view of fire
   patterns in different vegetation types.},

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {193},
Number = {3},
Pages = {373-390},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Sustainable yields that are at least 80\% of the maximum sustainable
   yield are sometimes referred to as ``pretty good yields{''} (PGY). The
   range of PGY harvesting strategies is generally broad and thus leaves
   room to account for additional objectives besides high yield. Here, we
   analyze stage-dependent harvesting strategies that realize PGY with
   conservation as a second objective. We show that (1) PGY harvesting
   strategies can give large conservation benefits and (2) equal harvesting
   rates of juveniles and adults is often a good strategy. These
   conclusions are based on trade-off curves between yield and four
   measures of conservation that form in two established population models,
   one age-structured model and one stage-structured model, when
   considering different harvesting rates of juveniles and adults. These
   conclusions hold for a broad range of parameter settings, although our
   investigation of robustness also reveals that (3) predictions of the
   age-structured model are more sensitive to variations in parameter
   values than those of the stage-structured model. Finally, we find that
   (4) measures of stability that are often quite difficult to assess in
   the field (e.g., basic reproduction ratio and resilience) are
   systematically negatively correlated with impacts on biomass and size
   structure, so that these later quantities can provide integrative
   signals to detect possible collapses.},

Title = {Ecology and Genetic Structure of the ParasitoidPhobocampe

   Hosts,AglaisSpecies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)},

Abstract = {The biology of parasitoids in natural ecosystems remains very poorly
   studied, though they are key species for their functioning. Here we
   focused onPhobocampe confusa, a Nymphalini specialist, responsible for
   high mortality rates in charismatic butterfly species in Europe
   (genusAglais). We studied its ecology and genetic structure in
   connection with those of its host butterflies in Sweden. To this aim, we
   gathered data from 428P. confusaindividuals reared from 6094 butterfly
   larvae (ofA. urticae,A. io, and in two occasions ofAraschnia levana)
   collected over two years (2017 and 2018) and across 19 sites distributed
   along a 500 km latitudinal gradient. We found thatP. confusais widely
   distributed along the latitudinal gradient. Its distribution seems
   constrained over time by the phenology of its hosts. The large variation
   in climatic conditions between sampling years explains the decrease in
   phenological overlap betweenP. confusaand its hosts in 2018 and the
   33.5\% decrease in the number of butterfly larvae infected. At least in
   this study,P. confusaseems to favourA. urticaeas host. While it
   parasitized nests ofA. urticaeandA. ioequally, the proportion of larvae
   parasitized is significantly higher forA. urticae. At the landscape
   scale,P. confusais almost exclusively found in vegetated open land and
   near deciduous forests, whereas artificial habitats are negatively
   correlated with the likelihood of a nest to be parasitized. The genetic
   analyses on 89 adultP. confusaand 87 adultA. urticaeusing CO1 and AFLP
   markers reveal a low genetic diversity inP. confusaand a lack of genetic
   structure in both species, at the scale of our sampling. Further genetic
   studies using high-resolution genomics tools will be required to better
   understand the population genetic structure ofP. confusa, its biotic
   interactions with its hosts, and ultimately the stability and the
   functioning of natural ecosystems.},

Title = {Selective decontamination and antibiotic resistance in ICUs},
Journal = {CRITICAL CARE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and selective oropharyngeal
   decontamination (SOD) have been associated with reduced mortality and
   lower ICU-acquired bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia rates
   in areas with low levels of antibiotic resistance. However, the effect
   of selective decontamination (SDD/SOD) in areas where
   multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are endemic is less clear. It
   will be important to determine whether SDD/SOD improves patient outcome
   in such settings and how these measures affect the epidemiology of
   multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Here we review the current
   evidence on the effects of SDD/SOD on antibiotic resistance development
   in individual ICU patients as well as the effect on ICU ecology, the
   latter including both ICU-level antibiotic resistance and antibiotic
   resistance development during long-term use of SDD/SOD.},

Abstract = {People derive benefits from river networks under free flowing
   conditions, through ecosystem services such as fishery yield, floodplain
   agriculture, desirable geomorphic form, and the cultural significance of
   native riverine biodiversity. However, water management decisions have
   historically emphasized the production of ecosystem services such as
   hydropower and irrigation that depend on the construction of extensive
   infrastructure. Such decisions typically impose tradeoffs that reduce
   benefits from free flowing services, yet neither these losses nor the
   costs of future ecosystem rehabilitation have been well represented in
   decision support analyses. Ecosystem service assessments can and should
   account for benefits in the absence of water infrastructure to inform
   balanced water policy and watershed management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Temperature dependence of fish performance in the wild: links with
   species biogeography and physiological thermal tolerance},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {903-912},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Temperature strongly regulates the distribution and fitness of
   ectotherms, and many studies have measured the temperature dependence of
   physiological performance in controlled laboratory settings. In
   contrast, little is known about how temperature influences ectotherm
   performance in the wild, so the ecological significance of physiological
   performance as measured in the laboratory is unclear.
   2. Our aim was to measure the temperature dependence of performance in
   the wild for several species of fishes and to explore how temperatures
   that maximize performance in the wild (T-optE) are related to species
   biogeographies.
   3. We gathered body activity and growth data from the wild for nine
   tropical and temperate fish species, and by fitting thermal performance
   curves to these data, compared T-optE to species-specific warm range
   boundary temperatures (the average temperature of the warmest month at
   equatorward range limits). To explore the degree to which trends in the
   wild reflect trends in physiological performance measured in the
   laboratory, we also compiled published data on the temperature
   dependence of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and compared these to
   our wild fish data.
   4. We found T-optE in the wild was strongly correlated with warm range
   boundary temperatures, and that the difference between these two
   temperatures (the `environmental heating tolerance') was smaller for
   more-tropical species. Comparison with laboratory data revealed that
   T-optE approaches warm boundary temperatures in the wild at the same
   rate that the optimal temperature for aerobic scope (T-optAS) approaches
   upper critical temperatures (upper T-crit) for aerobic scope in the
   laboratory, meaning that environmental heating tolerances in wild fishes
   closely mirror physiological heating tolerance (i.e. upper T-crit -
   T-optAS) in captive fishes.
   5. Our comparison of field-and laboratory-derived data highlights the
   ecological significance of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and
   suggests wild fish species tend to perform best near the highest
   temperatures encountered in their range while maintaining a safety
   margin from the deleterious effects of upper critical temperatures.},

Title = {Serological Evidence of Ebola Virus Infection in Indonesian Orangutans},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},

Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) belong to the family
   Filoviridae and cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman
   primates. Despite the discovery of EBOV (Reston virus) in nonhuman
   primates and domestic pigs in the Philippines and the serological
   evidence for its infection of humans and fruit bats, information on the
   reservoirs and potential amplifying hosts for filoviruses in Asia is
   lacking. In this study, serum samples collected from 353 healthy Bornean
   orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) in Kalimantan Island, Indonesia, during the
   period from December 2005 to December 2006 were screened for
   filovirus-specific IgG antibodies using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with recombinant viral surface glycoprotein
   (GP) antigens derived from multiple species of filoviruses (5 EBOV and 1
   MARV species). Here we show that 18.4\% (65/353) and 1.7\% (6/353) of
   the samples were seropositive for EBOV and MARV, respectively, with
   little cross-reactivity among EBOV and MARV antigens. In these positive
   samples, IgG antibodies to viral internal proteins were also detected by
   immunoblotting. Interestingly, while the specificity for Reston virus,
   which has been recognized as an Asian filovirus, was the highest in only
   1.4\% (5/353) of the serum samples, the majority of EBOV-positive sera
   showed specificity to Zaire, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, or Bundibugyo
   viruses, all of which have been found so far only in Africa. These
   results suggest the existence of multiple species of filoviruses or
   unknown filovirus-related viruses in Indonesia, some of which are
   serologically similar to African EBOVs, and transmission of the viruses
   from yet unidentified reservoir hosts into the orangutan populations.
   Our findings point to the need for risk assessment and continued
   surveillance of filovirus infection of human and nonhuman primates, as
   well as wild and domestic animals, in Asia.},
